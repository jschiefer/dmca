The repositories relating to device trees and kernel for the Samsung Exynos7580 android devices located at this project infringe copyright of a couple of different projects that I am either involved in or are the joint creator of.   
   
The project for these repositories is located here:   
https://github.com/BunsExynos   
   
The individual repositories I have issue with are:   
https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_device_samsung_a5xelte   
https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_vendor_samsung_a5xelte   
https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_device_samsung_exynos7580-common   
https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_vendor_samsung_exynos7580-common   
https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_kernel_samsung_exynos7580-common   
   
I believe that all of these repositories should be taken down.   
   
The repositories located here are almost identical to the original Exynos7580 repositories of the same name located here: https://github.com/Exynos7580. Instead of forking the repositories and making his changes the user "BunsExynos" cloned and pushed the changes into a single commit (example https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_device_samsung_exynos7580-common/commit/7d8367836028a227efefec243ce813a6bff1d68e) removing all authorship and attribution he then also changes the copyright in commits like this (https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_device_samsung_exynos7580-common/commit/f8bc072ec27c8c795f182b27340e7a2e7837025f#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8) so as to hide the original authors.   
   
Last year [private] and I created new clean Android device trees for the Exynos7580 based devices which were originally available here: https://gitlab.com/Exynos7580 and have subsequently been incorporated into the LineageOS project here: https://github.com/lineageos.   
   
We fixed many issues that plagued the old device trees and again, instead of forking our projects he cloned our repositories and pushed the changes in a single commit (example: https://github.com/BunsExynos/android_device_samsung_exynos7580-common/commit/16becba55c2a5165b8fac0a6fa8d59bc205c8937).   
   
Our code is all licenced under the Apache Licence v2 (and the LGPL v2 for the Linux Kernel sources) so he is free to use and make changes to the code but he must maintain attribution and copyright notices which he has not. He also uses these repositories in a fraudulant way to convince his users that it is all his original work and makes money from donations, although this is not an issue for the DMCA it gives some insight into the user at hand.   
   
I have previously contacted the user regarding the incorrect use of our work and have only met abusive repsonses.   
   
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.   
   
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.   
   
I have read your Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.
