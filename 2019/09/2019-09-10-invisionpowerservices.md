My name is [private] and I am an employee of Invision Power Services, Inc. A repository that your company is storing publicly, is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company.

The repo in question is distributing our software, IPS Community Suite, without a legal and valid license.

The unauthorized and infringing material can be found at:

https://github.com/viashop/forum


**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

This entire repository needs removing: https://github.com/viashop/forum

A PUBLIC repository that your company is storing, is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company.

The repo in question is distributing our software, IPS Community Suite, without a legal and valid license.

The unauthorized and infringing material can be found at:

https://github.com/viashop/forum

That entire repository is our software.

As a start, in the main folder is a file named “Credits.txt”.

Read it. That’s fairly obvious, however here are a few more files:

./applications/core/data/versions.json - That is the “versioning" file for our software.

Every one of our apps has a similar file:

./applications/XXXXX/data/versions.json - these are also ours.

Note the folder structure in that repo.

admin
api
applications
datastore
plugins
system
uploads

That is our software.

We use your service to host our own corporate repository. Look here for comparison:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not searched beyond the above repo. It was noticed by one of OUR licensed customers, and reported to me in the Piracy department.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The entire repo is our licensed and copyrighted work. This is not open source software in any manner.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

This repo must be permanently removed. Our license terms do not allow storing the software anywhere that the public can access it. It may be stored only on the site where it is running, or on the licensee's local computer.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I do not have the contact info. As noted above, this repo was reported to me in the Piracy department as distributing our software.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
