Hello dear github:

I am [private]
    
I am very happy to use a professional and efficient platform like github. Now I need to get support and help from GitHub.I created a repository called llt on GitHub in 2017, which contained some privacy files, so I deleted it. But it was forked by others before deleting. Existing already exists.
    
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Below are links and screenshots of GitHub:

Since the llt repository contains a lot of privacy files, I hope that GitHub will help me remove all the forks in the llt repository as soon as possible, thank you very much.
