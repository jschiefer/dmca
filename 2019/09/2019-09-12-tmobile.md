Contractors may also have access to confidential business information that can impact system security. Contractors are not supposed to put any of that information in a public forum.

3. Copyrighted software code that is, on information and belief, owned by T-Mobile and that contains confidential information like access codes, is being hosted on your service at the following GitHub repository:
