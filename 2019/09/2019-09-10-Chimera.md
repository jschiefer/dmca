**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/BrandonPlank/Reverse-Engineering is explicitly reverse engineering and copying components of the Chimera jailbreak https://chimera.sh/. It explicitly states this, and it is implied that they intend to copy the entirety of it. He has identified some functionality already and copied the generated pseudocode out of the dissassembler. This is not fair use as I understand the law.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
https://github.com/BrandonPlank/Reverse-Engineering

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks currently, though if there's any forks those will need to be taken down.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. The binaries are free, but the work is under a proprietary license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal only.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
[private]
