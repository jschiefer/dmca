Hi,     
     
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.     
     
Dmca : https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/09/2019-09-16-serveurmultigames.md       
My repo : https://github.com/FluorFR/Serveur-multigames     
     
My name is [private], my first name is [private]. I'm [private].My address is [private] and my phone number is [private].My email adresse is : [private]     

I received a DMCA complaint today about the code I have made. The applicant of the claim claims this code unfortunately it is the code that I realized myself. This person is currently using my code for commercial purposes, which is contrary to the publication license (Link: https://serveur-multigames.net ) . So I feel a little uncomfortable in this story.     
So I would like my repository come back.Because I counted on enriching the code that it contains and devlopper a community around this one. I thank you for reading my message     
In addition, the contestant is currently using my code for commercial purposes so I do not understand why I am stuck.     
     
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.       
     
I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
