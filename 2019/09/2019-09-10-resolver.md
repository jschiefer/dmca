**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have not been able to find any forks of these files on github or other services.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

While this project uses open source code, none of the files included in this takedown notice are licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

These repositories should be removed, as they already exist under the Resolver github organisation.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

Unfortunately, we don't. Their github account is very new with minimal information.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
