Since you apparently can't view your own company's private repositories, I am including additional links to where TNet can be obtained legally. TNet is a licensed networking add-on that's sold via the Unity's Asset Store. It's also housed on github in a private repository. TNet is NOT a public or open source tool, and should NOT be available freely on a public repository.     
     
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**     
     
https://github.com/kincjf/pixelcity-tnet-server     
     
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**     
     
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**     
     
The work is licensed, and is NOT open source.     
     
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**     
     
Yes, repository can be made private.     
     
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**     
     
There is no contact information.
