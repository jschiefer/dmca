**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

I'm [private] of ThoughtLeaders. All the code written in our private repository was written by myself or by ThoughtLeaders Team.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is our repository: [private]  
This is our website: app.thoughtleaders.io  
(the code is for the app once a user is logged in)

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
https://github.com/kdfwow64/thoughtleader-Django-React

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The user was a freelance developer we hired to work with us through [private], we terminated his work in a week since he was non responsive. he then copied the repository and added it to his github account. I don't really understand how i can see my commits there, since its not forked and our repository is private but we need this down immediately since this is doing damage to our business.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. this is not open source code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We need the copied repository removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
yes.
