**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I created a repository called "integrate-service" two years ago, which was a middle tier project to prepare resources and publish them to kinds of endpoints, such as website. The problem is that the repository contains system configuration information of out lab's machine, thus existing huge security threat. Later found that before I deleted the repository, the user named darknessitachi completely forked my entire repository, and it still exists.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

https://github.com/darknessitachi/integrate-service

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I have checked. The 1 above does not have any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is not under an open source license. This is my lab's private source code, containing docs and system configuration information, belonging to my lab's internal data assets.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I demand the code to be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No.
