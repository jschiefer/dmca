Dear Sirs/Madams,

We have been notified that licence keys and activation codes for products of our company JetBrains

Upsource, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, IntelliJ IDEA, AppCode, ReSharper, CLion,
DataGrip), the URLs of the illegally run license servers,
source and binary codes of illegal license servers, cracks (software which intentionally and
illegally modifies JetBrains tools in order to run it on behalf of a third party without an
authorization from JetBrains), and instructions on how to reset trial modes, use the cracks,
activation codes, and other methods which aim to circumvent technical measures protecting JetBrains
tools from unauthorized use, are publicly accessible on your website github.com.
