Yes, I am the owner of the copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

All of our work is here on github under private repositories. You can see screenshots of our work below, or if you have access to private repositories, you can see all of our work at [private]

Our work is entirely based around a multiplayer modification framework for an online game, and we sell our scripts online. The offending github was a seller from the same online store that we where apart of, and after disputes with the website owner, they've taken their revenge shot by open-sourcing our products on their github:

The following repositories are copies of our work:

https://github.com/Dqppp/MF_LockPicking

Our repositories of the same mods can be found at:

We sold our work on https://modfreakz.net and https://gta5-store.com  
You can still see previews of our work at https://modfreakz.net, but we've since taken our products from gta5-store.com since they have been leaked.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, there is no open source license available.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be to remove the offending user from your services entirely, as they knew exactly what they where doing the moment they uploaded them github.  
The next best course of action would be to remove our repositories from their github, and any others mentioned above.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**
