It came to our attention that the undermentioned websites are sharing part of Playstation's source code which they only make available under Non-Disclosure Agreement. This is a copyright infringement causing damage to our client Playstation, this part of the code is copyrighted by law and should not be distributed among non-employees of Playstation. On top of everything, the code is also CONFIDENTIAL and there cannot be any reference to it online because it is part of the upcoming PS5 Operative System.
