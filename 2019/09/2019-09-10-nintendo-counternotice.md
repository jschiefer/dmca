**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**    
  
I wish to dispute the notice.  
  
**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**    
  
Our team believes that the notice (https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/09/2019-09-04-Nintendo.md) was fraudulent and that the author does not represent the party that they claim to represent. This is based on the following:  
  
1) The notice alleges that one of our repositories contains "documentation that was not authorized to be distributed"; no documentation within our repositories has been sourced from Nintendo and it is all our own work, developed using legal means in accordance with applicable law, notably section 103(f) of the DMCA (17 U.S.C. § 1201 (f)) which permits reverse-engineering and circumventing any software protection if it is necessary in order to achieve "interoperability".  
2) The notice fails to specify any relevant patent numbers, copyright registrations or trademark registrations.  
3) The notice includes no reference to the specific entity that the author claims to represent, merely the vague name of "Nintendo", which could represent one of many of Nintendo’s corporate entities around the world; e.g. "Nintendo Co., Ltd." or "Nintendo of America Inc.".  
4) Nintendo trademarks are misspelt; e.g. "Nintendo Wifi Connection Service".  
5) There are numerous grammatical mistakes and nonsensical pseudo-legalese phrases in the notice; e.g. "[...] intends to add unauthorized modifications", "the work [...] is all rights reserved", "there is illegal emulation software".
