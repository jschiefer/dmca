Dear DMCA Agent:  

 I, [private], member of security team of bilibili and as authorized by bilibili, hereby submit the DMCA take down notice as below.  

 

 Thank you for taking down those infringing posts upon our previous request. However, we observe that some GitHub users are still continuously posting our source code.  

 

 After careful review of relevant posts on your website (detailed below), our security team is able to confirm that all these posts contain our source code and other trade secrets and confidential information (e.g., algorithm, system configuration, secret key, database address, important api key, etc.) that were published without appropriate authorization and thus are infringing.  

 

 As a leading PR entertainment website, bilibili has been investing tremendous resources and efforts to develop the information. Now that such information has been published without our authorization on your website, providing easy access to unnamed visitors, being forked over several thousand times and is still being shared and transferred from the original posts on GitHub continuously. As the posts contain invaluable information in such a detailed and comprehensive manner far beyond the necessary level of fair use, we confirm that all the use in the attached posts shall not be protected as fair use.  

 

 In consideration of significance and urgency of the aforesaid matters, we request that you pay serious attention to this letter and respond in a timely manner as requested.
