**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I have created the software myself and own all the rights to the software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original software can be purchased from https://repo.packix.com/package/com.jeffresc.lswatchdogs/. Please note that I do have a private repository that has the code for the software ([private]), but it is a private repository for obvious reasons being that it is a paid software.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The following URL pertains to my particular case, but the rest of the repository also contains other copyrighted code, but since I do not own the copyright for those, I am not seeking action for them.  

https://github.com/repoxox/repoxox.github.io/blob/master/debsthemes/com.xox.lswatchdogs_1.0.3.deb

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched for more forks and have not found any more infringing URLs at the time.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?** 

The original work is not licensed to anyone for any reason besides myself.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Since the original work must be paid for to obtain, I am requesting for the complete removal of the pirated code from their repository. If possible, I would like the entire repository taken down as it is full of pirated works from many other authors besides myself, but I would at least like my own code removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
