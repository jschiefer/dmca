Airbiquity usually include specific copyright proprietary information in the header of the code and include company name in the package name, this's an important proof of the copyright. You can find the copyright proprietary information and the package name from multiple files like:  
https://github.com/lostsakya/Git_code/blob/master/java_code/lcn2kaihup/hup.js  
https://github.com/lostsakya/Git_code/blob/master/android_code/androidhap/HeadUnitIdExtractor/src/com/airbiquity/hap/headunitidextractor/ActHelpAnswer.java

Nissan and Infiniti are two customers of Airbiquity, they are using Airbiquity's productions, one of the productions is the phone app which you can find from mobile application market: NissanConnect & Infiniti InTouch. There are two folders in Git_code repository have the same names, that's the source codes of these two apps:  
https://github.com/lostsakya/Git_code/tree/master/android_code/androidhap/NissanConnect  
https://github.com/lostsakya/Git_code/tree/master/android_code/androidhap/InfinitiInTouch

Base on above truths, it's clear that Git_code repository infringed the copyright of Airbiquity.
