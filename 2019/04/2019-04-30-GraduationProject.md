Hello, I am the creator of github organization [private] and one of the authors of the project [private]. In the beginning, I created this project and organization to share the work and progress of our graduation thesis within my team. But after the paper work was over, I forgot to delete the project. Now I realize that this may cause a privacy leak. The content of this git repository is the graduation thesis and code of my team, and my team and I have full ownership and copyright . The privacy content that may be revealed includes the real name, contact information and school of my team members. Most importantly, some code contains data that should not be exposed. I have deleted the main repository[private], but this repository has been forked by seven github users, I can't delete them. I contacted you to request Github to delete these seven forks. Thanks.

What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:
