I am [private] of Wavelength Automation, Inc, the holder of the copyright and trademark for CapitolTrack.    

I was notified on April 11, 2019, via Facebook, from someone named [private] that the source code for our CapitolTrack product was published on github. He provided the following link:   
https://github.com/gold-developer/capitoltrack  

I have confirmed that this is active development code and was taken from a project contracted with a programmer on [private]. That project has been cancelled.    

I am asking that the entire capitoltrack repository be removed.  

This is not an open source project.  

I am providing an image of a discussion I had regarding the removal of the repository.
