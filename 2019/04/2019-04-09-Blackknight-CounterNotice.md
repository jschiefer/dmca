I would like to dispute the notice

Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)  

I have reviewed the code described, and it turns out the complainant was in error. The code is   
1) not "confidential and proprietary information", and   
2) as noted in the very next line after naming Ernst Publishing in the Copyright line, the license is "Apache 2.0"  

Please let me know if anything more needs to be done, but I think that they're in the wrong here.  

Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled."
