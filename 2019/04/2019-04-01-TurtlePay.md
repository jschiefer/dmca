**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

AGPL-3.0: They are in violation of the license as the offenders have replaced the copyright notices that must remain intact via the license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I have already opened issues on all repos 3 days ago to request that they restore the copyright headers. This is the best core of action that they can take; however, they have failed to respond. At this point, removal appears to be the only reasonably action. Given the terms of the AGPL-3.0 license and the offenders use of the software via (https://zumpay.io/) taking the repositories private will not resolve the issue.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**
