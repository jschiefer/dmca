**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**
 
Yes. I am the sole copyright owner of the source, as it is a private closed source project that only I have access to work on.
 
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**
 
It’s a tool to convert the format of binary data of SNES video game ROM’s. I have made the binary only available here (http://darkakuma.z-net.us/p/sfromtool.html) inside of a .rar package.
 
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**
 
The entire project should be removed. https://github.com/Light-Kami/sfrom_tool
 
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
 
There are no forks that I know of. I was made aware of this theft 3 hours after the page was made, and was hoping to get it removed before such spreading as forking...
 
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**
 
No. It is entirely closed source and private.
 
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**
 
Complete removal. The source should not exist publically at all.
 
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**
 
No. Just the persons disposable github account that he created just to post my stolen source code and mock me by inverting my nick name for his own.
