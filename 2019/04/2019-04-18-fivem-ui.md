Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   
The project in question was originally a resource for a Grand Theft Auto V modifaction called FiveM. "esx_customui" was a resource developed by my former companion [private] for ADRP (American Dream Roleplay). This resource was never shared to the public, and our website is https://americandreamrp.com/  

#### Screenshots of the original work

The client assets are stored in cache files, and are encrypted somehow. The programming language is Lua. Someone had developed a "cache decryptor" tool and people that disliked the ADRP community used it.. STOLE & uploaded our private ingame HUD. This person in question created a github account https://github.com/Chubbz123. One of our developers' name is [private], but this account is a fake account. On this account this modder proceeded to upload our stolen hud in a repo called fivem-ui  

AFAIK we've already reported this account in the past but can't remember how it played out so we're trying again to claim what's ours.  

Later a lot of people had forked the 
fivem-ui account but I've already contacted them a long time ago and told them to remove their repos. But apparently there's still some of our stolen work out on github :/  

The real [private] account is [private]

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**   
Yes please also take town all the forks of the two URLs above. I have checked them all and can confirm that it's our stolen work. (I don't belive the forkers know about the stolen work)  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**   
The work licensed is licensed to ADRP and is NOT licensed under a open source license.  

When the modder who stole our assets uploaded the project to github HE added a GPLv3 license to it. We never licensed our resource/project to GPLv3 or any other open source license.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**   
Remove it since the project was stolen (but we have plans to release it to the public too)  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**   
I do not have this persons contact information but I know a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows this persons contact information. I warn you if you really want this persons contact info that it will be a unreliable source.
