**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**    
In this section, I would like to talk more about my repo and this accident as well as my shock. "https://github.com/BIAOXYZ/myNotes/" is a repo created at about August 2017. It is all about my personal (learning) notes (Notice its name, myNotes!). 80% of its content is about various programming languages, Linux, Database, container, academic paper, etc. Others are about life, like travel, history, literature, chess game, news etc. I personally think that the reason why this repo is banned is that there is one markdown file (Its name might be github.md) which recorded several links of repos that contain source code of the leaked Bilibili project and some IT reports of this accident from www.ithome.com. However, there is definitely no code of bilibili in my file!!! This markdown is mainly about "projects may be interesting on Github". Here, "interesting" has the meaning of influence in certain scope, for instance, 996.ICU and related repos are also recorded in this file. For me, it is only for the purpose of technical news. I do not care the code of Bilibili. It's a news, an event, or even gossip, but definitely not copyright violation. I don't think my markdown file would harm anyone, anything. Acutally, I am the guy who is been mistakenly hurted. There are about 24 hours that I cannot access my repo!
