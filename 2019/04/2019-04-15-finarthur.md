I have publish an open source project in github [private], later I realized the code and data contain sensitive private content and may cause law issue. I do not want the repo to be open to public, so I deleted my repo, but there are still many forked repos outside which I want them be deleted and not opened.

All the forked repos are required to be deleted, and it can be traced that all the commits belong to my account [private], the forked repos URL are listed bellow, maybe there are still other repos not listed here
