**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

I am authorized to act on behalf of Epic Games, Inc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Unreal Engine is the software of Epic Games, Inc. The site can be found here: https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/

Epic's own git is here: https://github.com/EpicGames where several repositories are gated behind linking an Epic account.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

Several repositories need to be taken down.   
https://github.com/EpicMegaGames/UnrealTournament   
https://github.com/EpicMegaGames/UnrealEngine   
https://github.com/EpicMegaGames/ARTv2   
https://github.com/EpicMegaGames/ThirdParty   
https://github.com/EpicMegaGames/Signup

The Signup repository listed above provides further evidence of the misused IP as it links back to Epic's official repositories (located at https://github.com/EpicGames) instead of https://github.com/EpicMegaGames.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

n/a

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, this is not Open Source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Taking down the repository is the best solution. The page is distributing protected IP.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
