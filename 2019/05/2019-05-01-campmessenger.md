**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Yes.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is a mobile app being created by my company, Camp Messenger. The infringer, mobilecareer123, has posted a version of the repository that he access to months ago in an effort to ransom money from us. The infringer contributed nothing to the project as he was a freelancer evaluating the project that we decided not to hire.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The entire repository:   
https://github.com/mobilecareer123/campmessenger

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, the infringer gained access to our private repository as a freelancer and has now posted the code to receive ransom. He has since been removed from the repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the application is the property of Camp Messenger, Inc.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be to remove the repository and deactivate the user's account not only for his hostility towards myself and my team but also to prevent further instances of this hostility against others.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

The infringer has harassed members of my team on social media using multiple fake accounts. He is currently hostile in communications. The method of communications used before his hostility was his Skype (username: [private]).
