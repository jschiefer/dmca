Hello Dear Github:     
    I'm [private] of AsiaInfo.It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully to get Github's support and resolution.     
   I have read and understand  Github's Guide to Filing  DMCA notice.     
   I created a Repository called  "asiainfoCode "  https://github.com/Lynwood01/asiainfoCode  in last year,which contained creators,contents and database configuration information are all owned by the company.Later found that befor we deleted,many users had forked our entire      
   Repository,and all it still exists.     
      The following is Github's URL about our forked Repository:     
     https://github.com/0xsb/asiainfoCode     
      https://github.com/fengclondy/asiainfoCode     
      https://github.com/fjfd/asiainfoCode     
      https://github.com/hey-hongh/asiainfoCode     
      https://github.com/ImQdf/asiainfoCode     
      https://github.com/p0tty-git/asiainfoCode     
      https://github.com/xiluo789/asiainfoCode     
      https://github.com/zggcd/asiainfoCode     
   Since "asiainfoCode" contains the company's important source code,algorithm and system configuration information,belonging to the company's internal data assets,so we hope Github as soon as possiable to help us completely remove
