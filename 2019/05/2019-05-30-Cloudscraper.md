**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?** 
Yes. I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work is here: 
https://github.com/codemanki/cloudscraper/blob/master/lib/browsers.json

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The file at the following location should be taken down: https://github.com/VeNoMouS/cloudscraper/blob/master/cloudscraper/user_agent/browsers.json

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes, it is licensed under the MIT License. The MIT License is a very simple license that requires the original copyright notice(s) remain present. The MIT License is being violated due to the removal of the project's copyright notice: `Copyright (c) 2019 Oleksii Sribnyi`. In addition, the individual file's copyright notice should be `Copyright (c) 2019 Rodney Teal`. The absence of these notices is a clear violation of the MIT License as quoted below.

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Other information: 
The work was contributed under the MIT License in accordance to the `inbound = outbound` clause of 
Github's Terms of Service. The work was contributed in the form of a PR that I authored and sent to 
https://github.com/codemanki/cloudscraper. The LICENSE is here: 
https://github.com/codemanki/cloudscraper/blob/master/LICENSE 
I have not signed a CLA or waived my copyright in any way thus I am still the copyright owner.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Add the proper copyright notices and stop the plagiarism. This is an issue for which I have sent many DMCA notices. I'd prefer to have the repository removed and the user blocked from Github services. I have contacted legal counsel to aid in sending additional DMCA notices.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:** 
[private]  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read our Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/

I hereby demand that the infringed content be removed. I urge you to act expeditiously.
