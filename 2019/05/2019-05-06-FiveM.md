The project in question was originally a resource for a Grand Theft Auto V modifaction called FiveM. "esx_customui" was a resource developed by my former companion "[private]" ([private]) for ADRP (American Dream Roleplay). This resource was never shared to the public, and our website is https://americandreamrp.com/

## This takedown is a new one, our friends sent us more repos of our stolen work. [The exact same code on many other repos had a successful DMCA](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/04/2019-04-18-fivem-ui.md)

When the modder who stole our assets uploaded the project to github HE added a GPLv3 license to it. We never licensed our resource/project to GPLv3 or any other open source license.

# What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?   
Remove it since the project was stolen (but we have plans to release it to the public too)
