I represent Galvanize Inc, owner of Hack Reactor, LLC whose protected intellectual property is being unlawfully posted by one of your users.    
  
Hack Reactor operates an immersive Javascript coding school, where we use our proprietary curriculum to help train stellar engineers. A student who dropped out of our program last year, [private] (handle:dnperera) has willfully posted our entire curriculum across a series of repositories on github. We've requested that he take these materials down several times and he has refused, claiming that "he doesn't have the time."  
  
[private] has 29 repositories associated with his account containing our property. Below are hyperlinks to all the individual repos;
