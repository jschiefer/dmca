To whom it may concern at Github,

My name is [private] and I am the [private] at Decisiv, Inc.  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  

Several repositories posted by GitHub user @www918 are unauthorized copies of work belonging to Decisiv Inc., and are infringing on several of our copyrights. We understand the mechanics of git, github, open source licensing, etc. This work is internal private work not meant for public exposure, and the person behind the account in question has never been authorized to possess this source code.  

These repositories we believe infringe on our copyright can be found at:  

https://github.com/WWW918/base-component   
https://github.com/WWW918/Decisiv-UI-Utils   
https://github.com/WWW918/Styled-Components-Reactive-Grid     
https://github.com/WWW918/Decisiv-fleet-web  

Further, one project has been forked 5 times to 5 other accounts, available at:   
https://github.com/itguru315/Decisiv-fleet-web

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above in the infringing github repos are not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

We do not know how the copies of these repos were acquired, but we are investigating. The last commit on the repositories in question was well before our move to hosted github (from GitHub Enterprise); it is possible these repositories were shared without authorization by an employee, or were on a stolen laptop.  

Based on our investigation starting with the github repo, we believe the account belongs to:  

[private]  
Skype: [private]  
[private]  

We expect these repositories to be removed from github immediately. We also expect [private] and all project forkers to delete all copies he may have of the associated code.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
