Dear Copyright Agent:

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:

I am an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular section(s) 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1) of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";

I May Be Contacted At:  
Name of Injured Party: TestDome Limited  
Name: [private]  
Address: [private]   
Company: TestDome Limited  
Email address: [private]  
Phone: [private]

I have a good faith belief that the source code snippets identified below (by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, they breach the copyright clause of TestDome's Terms of Use:  
https://www.testdome.com/legal/terms-of-use

Reason:  
Original content, including any solutions to original testing content are owned by TestDome Limited and are available only to our paying customers.  
Files found online are our (TestDome) templates for candidates to implement their solutions in so original authorship is split for all files. But, as candidates agree to our Terms of use before taking a test where they assign ownership of their solutions to us (TestDome).
