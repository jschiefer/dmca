Infringement Notice      
     
Dear Sirs/Madams,      
     
We have been notified that licence keys and activation codes for products of our company JetBrains s.r.o. (such as      
Upsource, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, IntelliJ IDEA, AppCode, ReSharper, CLion, DataGrip), the URLs of the illegally run license servers,      
source and binary codes of illegal license servers, cracks (software which intentionally and illegally modifies JetBrains tools in order to run it on behalf of a third party without an authorization from JetBrains), and instructions on how to use the cracks, activation codes, and other methods which aim to circumvent technical measures protecting JetBrains tools from unauthorized use, are publicly accessible on your website github.com.      
     
JetBrains s.r.o. is an owner of registered trademarks for all of the products specified above, those are proprietary desktop software products.      
     
IMPORTANT: Please note that:     
     
1) https://github.com/shanruopeng/Common-Software-License/wiki/IntelliJ-IDEA includes "License server address: [private]" but it does not  include a license key itself.      
     
JetBrains software is protected by a mechanism, which can check a user via license server. If the user is valid, the license server authorizes the user to use their instance of the software. None of legally run license servers are public and open for unlimited number of people. In opposite, illegally run license servers, such as [private] authorize unlimited number of users to run their software on behalf of third party, which is explicitly prohibited by a respective JetBrains software license. Therefore, running a license server at [private] is an act of the license violation, as well as publishing this address anywhere. The license server at [private] is a software intentionally circumventing technical measures protecting JetBrains software from unauthorized use.     
     
2) https://github.com/tadeugr/tadeugr-howto/wiki/Phpstorm consists of a link to an external site, and the site loads (see screnshot attached), but it takes from one to several minutes for it to load. It's located behind Chinese firewall, and some of connections might not be as fast as one expects.     
     
     
The materials infringing JetBrains s.r.o. rights mentioned above are to be found in particular on the following links:
