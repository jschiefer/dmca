My name is [private] and I am authorized to represent our client, AMP Capital, with DMCA claims.

 

The original copyrighted work is the AMP Self-Managed Superannuation Fund Dashboard, which can be found here:

The URL containing the repository being reported is at: https://github.com/devotion-jowen/AMPSMSF/tree/3710017b376f11ef411fe3ddc14512ec30adb18b

 

As you can see, the AMP SMSF's entire code is in the repository, and it has been posted without permission. Specifically, the web.config file, which contains pretty much everything there is to the website's layout and content, can be found here: https://github.com/devotion-jowen/AMPSMSF/blob/3710017b376f11ef411fe3ddc14512ec30adb18b/SMSFApp/web.config

 

There are no relevant forks, as the entire repository is infringing upon the AMP website's source code.

 

The work is under the AMP Limited copyrighted license, registered in 2019. We strongly suggest the removal of the entire repository, for the entirety of it contains the source code for AMP's website.

 

Unfortunately, we do not have the infringer's contact details. However, we are able to secure the LinkedIn account of the repository's owner. You may attempt to contact the owner of the account, but there is no guarantee that he still has access to it. Here's the LinkedIn account of the repository's owner: [private]

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

I have read and understoood the Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice found at https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/
