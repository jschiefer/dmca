**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**   
Yes, I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   
It is a repository of [private] coursework in Georgia Tech. It was meant to be shown to employers, not be shared with collaborators (as per the Georgia Tech Honor Code). After (what's assumed to be) another student from Georgia Tech forked my repository, other students have forked from their fork, furthering the distribution of code that should not be shared. 
[private]

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**   
The ENTIRE repositories of the following URLs are the infringing content. There have been no additional commits since they forked from my repository, which means they just plagiarized my work in its entirety and have not altered it to make it their own.   
https://github.com/AnthonyBrookss/GT-Classes   
https://github.com/jahinjin/GT-Classes

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**   
Yes, I have searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing repositories. The repositories themselves are forks of the infringing content, and I did not identify any further repositories that directly copy from my work.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**   
No, the work is not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**   
The best solution for the alleged infringement is to delete the repositories on Github and remove any files on local machines. The repository cannot be made private, or exist on any other platform for distribution or viewing.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**   
No, I do not have the alleged infringers contact information.
