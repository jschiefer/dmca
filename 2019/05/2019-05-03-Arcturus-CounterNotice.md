Arcturus Emulator was a free opensource emulator released under the GPL License. It has multiple authors and the main author decided to close source the project without contacting others, therefore breaking his own GPLv3 license. The software does not require you to register to download it and it can be found directly at https://arcturus.pw/mirrors/. This fork was a result of the developers who worked on the project wanting to continue it without the involvement of the original code developer who does not even attest to his own license, and continues to break it. The original commit shows the original license file intact if you wish to view it. You do not have to agree not to decompile at ANY POINT before downloading the software.
