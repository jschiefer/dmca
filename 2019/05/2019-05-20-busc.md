2.Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.

answer:  
All the original work are on these five accounts :[private],[private],oldweima,witnesslq,net-boblog , most of the content is uploaded by them seperately , and a small part is forked from other account , eg.  https://github.com/oldweima/swGis &   https://github.com/net-boblog/swGis  & https://github.com/witnesslq/swGis are all forked from [private].
