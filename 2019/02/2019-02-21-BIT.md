I am the copyright owner of the code in the infringing repositories.  

The original work that has been infringed is available in the following places.  
[private]  

These entire repositories are infringing and must be taken down:

I have not explicitly searched for forks, although all of these repositories
came up in a search using a canary term from the original work.  

The work is not licensed under an open source license - the work is supplied
to my students purely for use in an assessment task with explicit instructions
not to redistribute it.  

I do not have the contact information for the owners of the github accounts.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above
on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent,
or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is
accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of
the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  

I confirm that I have read your guide to submitting a DMCA.
