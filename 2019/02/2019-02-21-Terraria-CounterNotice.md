Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?  
Yes, I am. (I do not own the decompiled original language files stored there, though - they are owned by Re-Logic)

What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:

Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?  
I want to dispute the notice. My repository contained language files of the decompiled game code, which were only used to improve the German translation, while staying in contact with the developers of the game. No monetization was done and no unnecessary code distributed.

Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)  
I believe the takedown of my repository conflicts with the fair-use doctrine. My fork was used to provide a better German translation for the decompiled game Terraria and the results were even send to the developers themselves - hence, this repository was created to criticise the original work and for research and development purposes to the game creators' benefit (following a screenshot of my last email received from Re-Logic [developers of Terraria]).
