**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My book, Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python, is authorized to be sold and distributed by me/the PyImageSearch brand exclusively:

https://www.pyimagesearch.com/deep-learning-computer-vision-python-book/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The entire repository should be removed as it includes both the PDF and code from my book:

https://github.com/IceyQ/DL4CV

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

These are the forks that I found but I'm not sure if there are others:

https://github.com/saikrishna76/DL4CV-1   
https://github.com/alcarazolabs/DL4CV-1   
https://github.com/ferrygun/DL4CV-1

I think GitHub provides a tool to detect the other forks?

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, my work is not under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repo should be removed. Making it private is not an option since the book + code was pirated.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I do not.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
