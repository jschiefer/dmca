**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

It is not licensed as open source. The Pro license is [available here](https://fontawesome.com/license).  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

It looks pretty suspicious to us. Since it only contains Font Awesome Pro our guess is that its intention is to make our commercial product available for free to other users who are not licensed to use it. However, if the repository was private this would alleviate the copyright infringement.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

We don't. We looked on their profile page but no contact information is available and we don't have enough information to go from to identify them as a customer in our system.  

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."**
