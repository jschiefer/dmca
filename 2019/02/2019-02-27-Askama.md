**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  

Yes.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

https://github.com/djc/askama

[private]

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

Yes, the work is dual licensed under the MIT license or Apache 2. The allegedly infringing distribution is distributed under the same licenses, but violates the attribution requirements for either of the original works' MIT or Apache 2 licenses.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

The derived work must properly attribute copyrights to the original work. I have requested the owner to come into compliance in their repository: [private]; specifically, I suggested they "add a copy of the MIT license with my name in it, a mention in the README that this is a fork from Askama".

No.
