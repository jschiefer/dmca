Hello Dear Github：

It's nice to be able to use github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

I have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.

Before, because I didn't understand Chinese law, I mistakenly linked government projects to github and made them public! But now, the company's top management found and held my criminal responsibility, saying that I leaked government secrets. I realized the seriousness of the problem and immediately removed the repo under our organization. I thought things would come to an end. The company's top management once again found a forked repo on github and immediately ordered me to delete it immediately. Therefore, I was expelled from the company! These days, I also tried various ways to contact the user, but I won't get a reply, so I hope github can help me!

The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about our forked Repository：

Since all of the above are projects with the government, the Chinese government pays special attention to similar information security, and the HTML code in the project cannot be made public. I hope github can help me delete these repositories, and I guarantee that the users of the above branches have not made any changes, so I like github to help me delete these repositories, thank you very much!
