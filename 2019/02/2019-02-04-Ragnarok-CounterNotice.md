Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?    
I would like to dispute the notice, the only things can be considered copyrighted in this repo are two files and it's very controversial :    
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vthibault/roBrowser/blob/master/src/DB/Skills/SkillDescription.js  
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vthibault/roBrowser/blob/master/src/DB/Items/ItemTable.js  
The repository doesn't include any Ragnarok Online resource, only code written from scratch, if the two files are the one causing problem I will be happy to delete them but it should not impact the whole project, royalty free. If you need precisions you can ask me direcly.  

Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)  
All videos, images of the projects are showing Ragnarok Online resources, but in fact this resources are not included into the repository, and it's up to the user to use Ragnarok Online copyrighted resources or other ones (there are royalty free projects running roBrowser).   This is just a client, feeding himself with what you give to him.
