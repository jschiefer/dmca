**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**     
Yes, I am the copyright owner. My name is [private] I am [private] at Polytechnic University of Madrid.     
     
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**     
The original work is a practical assignment (to develop a Minishell) I put to my students as a part of the subject (Operating Systems) I lecture at the Polytechnic University of Madrid.     
The original sources should NOT be online for the general public, but only for the enrolled students, but other University have been using it and have put it in public. (I'll ask them to remove it soon).     
The related URLs are:     
  * The provided original sources, dated back 2009, in a .tar.gz archive, all with "Copyright (c) 1993-1999, [private]" are here (but it will also be removed from public access soon):    [private] 
  * A document (in spanish) dated back to 2001 Feb 22 and authored by me ([private]) explaining to the students what they have to do:    [private]   
  * Inside that document the section "4. LLAMADAS AL SISTEMA: Minishell" explaining this project: [private]     
  * And in the subsection "4.3 CÃ³digo Fuente de Apoyo" the original explanation of the given sources (main.c was later renamed msh.c), all of them copyrighted by me: [private]     
     
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:**     
The specific files are named:     
    Makefile   main.c   msh.c   parser.y   scanner.l   y.c        
The "main.c" file have been renamed to "msh.c".     
There are several student repositories under the same case.

NO other solution than to remove all the named files from the repository, and from any possible fork.     
     
**Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:**     
NO.
