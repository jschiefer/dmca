A the beginning I would like to state that I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

In 2013 I've written a thesis at the university entitled: "Mobile getourist guide for smartphones working on Android Operating System". The core of the project was an Augmented Reality engine that helped tourists discover points of interest through camera view on Android devices. A couple of years later I wrote a blog post on my companies blog:

[private] that was based on my thesis. I also published an example code on my Github: https://github.com/lycha/augmented-reality-example.

Yesterday I found out that my work was stolen and blog post was published by [private] on his Medium profile:

[private] without mentioning me as the original author. He also copied my code to his own repository and linked in the blogpost as his work: https://github.com/Mravatech/augumened_reality.

Whole mentioned above repository violates my copyrights and should be taken down. My code is published under GPL-2.0 license and if [private] would like to use it in his own work he should:

1) fork my repository not copy as his own   
2) state in the readme file that I am the original author of the code.   
3) or make it private  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
