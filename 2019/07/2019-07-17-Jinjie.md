The link I submitted is an infringing link, not a user profile, but some repository.    
    
Based on a representative number of forks I have reviewed, I believe that all or most of the forks are infringing to the same extent as the parent repositories.    
    
These links consist Jinjie information and needs to be removed in its entirety - note again, Jinjie holds the copyright to all of the content so they must be taken down. We do not have the infringer's contact information.    
    
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.    
    
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.    
    
Since you postpone the deletion of the link time, today we find that more people have a forked repository, which is the disaster you causedÔºÅ    
    
We suspect that GitHub Team deliberately disclosed information and did not delete the repository, because we have submitted many applications over and over again, please give us an accurate answer.    
    
Please delete these links immediately. The disclosure of these data has seriously affected us and caused economic losses to us. You have been dragging on for a long time!
