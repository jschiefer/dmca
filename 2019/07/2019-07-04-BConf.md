I'm the copyright owner.

I'm the owner of the website template which I sell on various marketplaces (https://bconf.themelabs.co.uk/). The user https://github.com/olagokemills has obviously just stolen the front-end source code of the page, changed it a little bit and posted here: https://github.com/olagokemills/employability-page. It is against the law to publish this code even if he bought the template, but it's apparent that the code was just grabbed from the demo web-page.

I insist that the whole project https://github.com/olagokemills/employability-page should be taken down. I insist on the removal. Please don't just make it private.

I don't have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read your Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/
