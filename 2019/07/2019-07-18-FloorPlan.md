I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.     
     
**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**      
Yes, I am [private] at the company whose works have been infringed and am authorized to act on the company's behalf.     
     
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**      
We received an email from Google Cloud informing us that our public API Key was published into a code repo on github.      
https://github.com/RaulCalderon/WadeJurney/blob/f6c89737b293581320ae40db5141f48de2223e43/Builder_UX-master/assets/flexplan/directives.min.js     
     
We found that our Floor Plan product was copied into a repository and renamed 'FlexPlan'.      
[private]  

This was found in the github account for [private] (https://github.com/RaulCalderon) in the repository named WadeJurney (https://github.com/RaulCalderon/WadeJurney)     
     
Upon further inspection, we found our code is embedded in a portion of this wordpress plugin called 'FlexPlan'. We found a code repository for this from Jan 2018: https://github.com/devworkr/FlexPlan     
     
This code was copied down from our hosted site at [private] and the entire directory of files was copied in https://github.com/devworkr/FlexPlan     
     
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**      
Everything in https://github.com/RaulCalderon/WadeJurney/tree/master/Builder_UX-master/assets/flexplan and https://github.com/devworkr/FlexPlan     
     
In fact, you can see in the HTML files that the comments directly say the code was copied down from our host ([private])      
[private]  
An example can be seen in many of the files in the directory https://github.com/devworkr/FlexPlan/blob/master/templates/ or https://github.com/RaulCalderon/WadeJurney/blob/master/Builder_UX-master/assets/flexplan/templates/. For example https://github.com/RaulCalderon/WadeJurney/blob/master/Builder_UX-master/assets/flexplan/templates/floorplan.html and https://github.com/devworkr/FlexPlan/blob/master/templates/rotateControl.html     
     
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**      
Yes, we searched and found the two repositories reference above.     
     
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**      
No, the work is not registered under open source outside of the angular framework.     
     
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**      
This code is a direct copy of ours with no attempt to change it and must be taken down. Even the code comments are copied.     
     
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**      
No. We only have the github accounts and a linkedIn account: https://github.com/RaulCalderon, [private], and https://github.com/devworkr. There is also a reference to [private] as a contributor to https://github.com/devworkr/FlexPlan.
