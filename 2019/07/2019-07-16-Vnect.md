The code, model, and data are made available for non commercial usage with the explicit condition that they may not be redistributed or repackaged in any form whatsoever, so that we as the creators can ensure that commercial entities may not exploit our work.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

[private]'s repository titled vnect_estimator was removed by him on request, but forks of it still persist. That repository had weights of our trained model, both in the original format as well as in various converted formats.  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**   
The repositories are in violation of the conditions of the license, which is even included in the zip files in the listed repositories (https://github.com/Lokidda/posestimation_realtime/blob/master/mpii_vnect_model_code.zip)  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**   
Being in violation of the conditions of the license, we would ideally like to revoke the users' access to the model, code, and data, and can't trust that the users would not further proliferate the code through other channels.

No, else would have tried to get in touch myself.
