Dear Github staff,

My name is [private] and I am a french digital artist (pseudonyme  
[private]) and owner of http://windows93.net and [private]  
A web page that your company hosts is infringing on at least one copyright owned by me.

My work Windows93 has been copied onto your servers without permission. The original written work to which we own the exclusive copyrights can be found at:

http://v1.windows93.net and http://windows93.net

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at:

https://github.com/windows93net/v1-windows-93-repo uploaded by this fake account: https://github.com/windows93net

The following is a sample (and not the entirety) of the content that has been copied
without permission:

view-source:http://v1.windows93.net/

The Github user [private] has first downloaded our website found at http://
v1.windows93.net and started to share our code on github without permission, I asked him amicably to remove my content a few months ago, I had to write him a lot of messages to get my code offline as I didn’t wanted to listen to me, but finally he created a fake « [private] / windows93.net » account to impersonate me and fool windows93’s fans as well as my followers. As a professional digital artist this is very annoying and dangerous for the viability of my futur artistic projects.

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of infringing material to your server in the future.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly.

Thank you.
