Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an [private] at the [private] at the London School of Economics and Political Science. [private] the course MY470 Computer Programming and in 2017 I created the organization lse-my470 to manage course materials and student assignments. Apart from student assignments, I and a few of my colleagues created all course materials.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

While the lecture content is public (e.g. https://github.com/lse-my470/lectures) we need to keep assignments and the example answers to these assignments private so that we can reuse them to assess students. Previous students, however, appear to have forked the assignments/example answers publicly or straightaway copied them in their GitHub accounts. I attempted to contact these students to take the materials down but I did not succeed in establishing contact. My guess is that they used their university e-mail address to create their GitHub account and are no longer tracking it (nor receiving e-mail notifications since their university e-mail accounts expired).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

I have not found any.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

N/A

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

The repositories should be either removed or made private.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
