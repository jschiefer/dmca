Hello Dear Github:

We Are:

Beijing BER Technology Development Co., Ltd. .It is nice to be able to yse Github such a professional and effcient platform,and mpw we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Someone created a repository called "sinopec" that many people forked or cloned and then re-uploaded the repository, which contained our company's product source code and too many sensitive information, such as usernames and passwords. Service address, database address, very important api key, etc. If this information is discovered by others in Github, our company will suffer significant losses.

This project is a project developed by our company for Sinopec Group. The following are the proof materials of [private] and Sinopec cooperation and product ownership.
