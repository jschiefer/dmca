Megvii-CSG is our account for sharing some open source projects on github，but unfortunately we made a mistake that we uploaded a project which should not be made public.And the mistakenly uploaded project is named nori that the version number is nori2-1.9.18, which is our private project，and we have removed it from our open source project to prevent further spread.
The following is the URL to our open source project on github:
https://github.com/Megvii-CSG/MegReader
However,we found that the original project already had 36 forks,so we hope github support can help us to remove them.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
