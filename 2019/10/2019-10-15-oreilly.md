**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am the copyright holder.  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am [private] book and it clearly states me as the copyright holder in the PDF.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
XQuery, by Priscilla Walmsley, published by O'Reilly Media  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repositoryâ€™s URL.**  
  
https://github.com/crafts-dev/software-development-ebooks-1/blob/master/%5BXQuery%20Search%20Across%20a%20Variety%20of%20XML%20Data%202nd%20Edition%20by%20Priscilla%20Walmsley%20-%202016%5D.pdf  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
Yes. There are 162 Forks. They all need to be taken down. See below. I submitted a similar request yesterday but realize now I was reporting a fork instead of the original repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
No  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
In my opinion, the entire repository and all of its forks should be completely removed because their whole purpose is to pirate copyrighted books.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringerâ€™s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
Apparently [private], github user [private], but he claims that the original repo is not his repo, even though he is the only contributor.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
