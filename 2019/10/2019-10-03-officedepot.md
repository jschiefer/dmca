Dear Github Team,

I am legal counsel to Office Depot, Inc., owner of certain the copyrighted material that has been posted to the personal repository of user "scurrent".  I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The material located at the two urls below was copied from Office Depot's private company repository and copied to a former Office Depot associate's personal repository (the code itself makes reference to "Office Depot".)  The copyright to this material is owned by Office Depot and the user "scurrent" is not authorized to publish it on his personal account.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.  I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
