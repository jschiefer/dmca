While working together with [private], we created an unfinished LeanPub book where I was the main author. He filed DMCA takedown doe LeanPub and it was taken down and thus publication from LeanPub is no longer available (https://leanpub.com/mobprogramming-guidebook/). He copied a version to his github repository (https://github.com/isidore/mobprogrammingguidebook.github.io/blob/master/images/mobprogrammingguidebook.pdf) that is illegal as per his own request to LeanPub. I asked to take the material down with an issue on Apr 7th (https://github.com/isidore/mobprogrammingguidebook.github.io/issues/1) and he doxxed me by registering copyright revealing my home address without my knowledge or consent on April 30th ([private])     
     
I kindly request you to remove the pdf from github and stop serving it on github pages. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
