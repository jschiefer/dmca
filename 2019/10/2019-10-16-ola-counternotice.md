**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am one of the two authors of the source code repository in question.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/sumeshpremraj/Ola-Now

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

1) This code was developed by me and my friend in the Ola API hackathon event held in 2015, please see the details here: https://www.hackathon.com/event/ola-api-hackathon-18742990790

2) The notice claims this:

"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.olacabs.customer&hl=en
-This is the original app where the source code was extracted. According to OLA, the source code found on the reported repository belongs to them."

This code is a fully originally work by us, and not in any way extracted from the Ola Android app. This is Python and Javascript code to run on a webserver and browser, while Ola app linked in the notice runs on Android mobile OS.

Notice claims "Also on a security point of view, the source code of the app leaked and exposed online can be used for phishing activities and take advantage of the information made publicly"

This is only for demonstration purposes against a sandbox API provided by Ola for the hackathon, and does not work when used against the public API (as noted in the readme file), so this claim is also false.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
