**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I run the site YayText.com

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original work lives at https://yaytext.com. The infringer wrote code to scrape the yaytext.com, and then modified the code to make it look like an original work.  

The infringers code lives at https://github.com/M692/BoldTextGenerator and is served at https://m692.github.io/BoldTextGenerator/  

There is a log file in the infringer's repo proving that they scraped the site:   https://github.com/M692/BoldTextGenerator/blob/master/report.txt  

Additionally, the source code at https://m692.github.io/BoldTextGenerator/ references YayText.com, the ad units on YayText, etc. The infringer links to the github.io URL from https://sites.google.com/view/the-home-of-m692/my-software where they claim that they "wrote" the code, this is not true. It is scraped.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The repository https://github.com/M692/BoldTextGenerator  
The files served at https://m692.github.io/BoldTextGenerator/  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

I have not found any forks  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

Not Open Source  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

I would like repo with YayText's scraped code removed, I would like the code not to be served, and I would like the infringer not to claim that they wrote the code.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
