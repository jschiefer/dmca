We're the author of StartSharp product, which has a commercial license, and doesn't allow redistribution in source form. One of our customers (we believe unknowingly) shared two projects that contain StartSharp code publicly. We tried to contact this user by email, and hopeful that he will delete / make private his repositories soon.
