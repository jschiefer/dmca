Hello Github, 

 

It has come to Mastercardâ€™s attention that Github user yoxovic has posted copyright Mastercard data on Github at the following location - https://github.com/yoxovic/MP-SDK-1.0.6d

 

The repository contains information for the MasterCard Mobile Payment Software Development Kit which is not authorized to be posted or shared by external users.  The repository is a direct copy and paste of Mastercard data. 

 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.


Thanks!
