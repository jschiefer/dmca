YGOPro 222DIY, is a custom card community making Yu-Gi-Oh custom cards. We accept custom cards from other custom card authors and share with each other. It's only a re-creation of Yu-Gi-Oh, but it does not contain any copyright images or works from the original Yu-Gi-Oh.
I really believe this takedown was a mistake. The materials used for making custom cards had no relationship with the original Yu-Gi-Oh works.
