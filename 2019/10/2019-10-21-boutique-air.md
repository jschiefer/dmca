Hello,

My company, Boutique Air wrote this code for use inside our company only.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is code that we use internally at our company. It was stolen (most likely by a contractor).

All the files located here:

And here:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes. These are the only ones we have found.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This work is 100% built by my company and is not available to anyone under any license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository needs to be deleted immediately.

I do not have the alleged infringer's contact information.
