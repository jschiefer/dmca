Dear Github team,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

My intellectual property which could be found on the following link was downloaded without my permission and uploaded to Github: https://themeforest.net/item/florence-responsive-wedding-site-template/7755165

The user "verlyananda" used a tool "HTTrack" to steal this template. I tried to contact him but he is not responding to my messages. You can find his files here: 

https://github.com/verlyananda/verlyananda.github.io

I would like to see my template removed from Github.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Kind Regards,
