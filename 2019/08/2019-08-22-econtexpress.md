Dear Sir or Madam, 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I'm developer of WordPress plugins. I have developed a WordPress WooCommerce plugin called WooCommerce Econt Express shipping plugin. I'm distributing this plugin through my website at https://mreja.net/produkt/woocommerce-econt-express-shipping-plugin/. My plugins  are developed and distributed under a propriety license and you can read the terms at  https://mreja.net/software-license-agreement/ and are distributed only by my company's website at https://mreja.net for a reward. I noticed that two of your subscribers have published an older versions of my plugin without my permission and against my will. Below you can find links to repositories hosted on your servers which are distributing my WooCommerce Econt Express shipping plugin without my permission:

1. https://github.com/ivko/woocommerce-econt

2. https://github.com/ngrudev/Woocommerce-Econt

As an author of this software I'm asking you to remove (delete) the code of my software from your servers as soon as possible because this is causing a financial and reputation damage to me and to my company.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Best Regards,
