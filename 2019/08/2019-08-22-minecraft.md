Dear Sir or Madam, 

This is a Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) Notice of Infringement pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512. 
Microsoft Corporation (“Microsoft”) has created and licenses the proprietary video game software known as Minecraft (http://www.minecraft.net), which is the work being infringed here. In addition to Microsoft’s copyright in Minecraft, Microsoft has registered the Minecraft mark (registration numbers: 4252394 and 009649691, among others), and has various protected and registered copyright related to Minecraft (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”). 

The software being distributed on the reported site, here: https://github.com/ian13456/mc.js violates these rights by providing users with an application that purports to act as a copy of Minecraft using javascript, encouraging users to provide their official Microsoft logins and circumvent Minecraft’s servers and logins for official gameplay.

On top of that, the download is being advertised with copyrighted Minecraft imagery and textures, acting as the backdrop to the site, without Microsoft’s consent or authorization. This is not an action protected by any fair use doctrine.

I, [private], am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is being infringed. I am writing to complain about the infringement of Microsoft’s Intellectual Property Rights identified by the following URLs:

https://github.com/ian13456/mc.js

I may be contacted as follows: [private]

I hereby state that I have a good faith belief that the disputed use of the copyrighted material or reference or link to such material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law (e.g., as a fair use).   
The information in this notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, I am authorized to act on behalf of Microsoft, Corporation., the owner of an exclusive right that is being infringed. 

Regards,   
[private]
