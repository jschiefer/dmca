**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?** 

These codes belong to a Server which I adminstrate called Insomnia RP. Which is a Five M roleplay server. These codes were stolen from the server from the individual who posted who was recentley fired from their Dev position and now he is posting it on git hub. All codes there are made by Insomnia RP's dev team and not that individual and we have custom codes/scripts there for the server we use that we not like to be leaked.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.** 

[private]. This is the discord for the server these codes belong to and here is the link to the actual Five M sever. https://servers.fivem.net/servers/detail/142.44.143.212:30120 . All these codes are active scripts/coding in Insomnia and is the property of Insomnia Roleplay

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

https://github.com/cmfarmer53/FiveM-Server/tree/master/resources . The whole resource needs to be taken down because the whole folder is Insomnia RP property and we have special coding in their with custom scripts that we like to keep private

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

EUP folder and we have custom plate script in there that we made that is being leaked by a adminstrator who was fired from their position and is now leaking our codes because he is mad.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

These files are not under any open source licenses at all. Most of these are custom codes built and made by insomnia Rp and they are now being unlawfully released by a individual not a part of Server at all and was fired. Most of these codes are very good and custom the Administration team at Insomnia RP would like for all these files to stay private because of this belonging to our server

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We would like to have the whole post possibly removed so it can be kept private and our codes will not be out there or possibly private so nobody else can see it please.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:** 

Yes I have his discord name which is [private] . Is where you can contact the indivudal who is posting our Resources without permission and that he does not own and is property of Insomnia RP.
