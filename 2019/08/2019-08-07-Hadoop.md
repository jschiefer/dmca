hello Dear github   
   
I am so appreciated that you help me delete this repository，but there is still a problem.   
   
I created a repository called "Hadoop" in last year ,which contains sensitive information,   
   
after we deleted repository(JUN 26) ,the user named bigdadwolf Create an account in JUN   
   
and upload the same repository, and which user bigdadwolf uploaded stillexists.    
   
I have submitted DMCA takedown notice（Ticket ID: [private])   
   
   
   
After that, we found that another repository called "HadoopOne" which upload by user named bigdadwolf, inside this repository is a folder called "SRC", which is copied from the original “Hadoop” ，I hope Github as soon as possible to help me completely remove it .
