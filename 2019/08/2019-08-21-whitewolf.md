Dear Sir/Madam

First, we have read and understand GitHub's Guide to file a DMCA Notice. Secondly, this is an updated request (the first request was missing required details)

It has come to our attention that the book Kithbook Eshu, a property of WHITE WOLF ENTERTAINMENT AB (White Wolf being an affiliate of Paradox Interactive AB) is being distributed illegally without our authorization through GitHub. Kithbook Eshu has been created and published by WHITE WOLF ENTERTAINMENT AB since 2001. For more information about Kithbook Eshu please visit the websites of our official distributors: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/174/Kithbook-Eshu or here https://www.amazon.com/Kithbook-Eshu-OP-Changeling-Dreaming/dp/1565047850.

The following information is presented for the purposes of removing content that infringes on our copyright per the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. We appreciate your enforcement of copyright law and support of our rights in this matter.

The URL of the infringing content is listed below: 

https://github.com/Transl8tor/KithbookEshu

The person behind the account has uploaded approximately half of the book and it has come to our knowledge, through our community, that this is in order to test how "copyright-proof" it is to upload books on GitHub,

It is important for us to protect our property from unauthorized use, therefore we respectfully request that you immediately remove the infringing material from GitHub.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the allegedly infringing web page is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.

Signed on this day, August 19th, 2019, Stockholm, Sweden.

Thank you.
