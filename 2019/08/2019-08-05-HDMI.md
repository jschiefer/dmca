**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  
  
Yes  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
HDMI Licensing Administrator, Inc. submitted a DMCA Take Down Notice once on the same GitHub user before however there has been a removal and now a redirect to a archive website that has the copyrighted work. As well the description is ambiguous as to indicate it's something different then what is actually within the link.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
We have searched other forks and this is the only instance we can find at this time.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
This is not open source and is a direct violation of the license.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
Any instances of this should be removed completely, and no redirection of archived records. This is blatant willful intent to violate a confidential document.  
  
Here's an example of his redirect:  
  
https://web.archive.org/web/20190228210610/https://glenwing.github.io/docs/hdmi-1.4b.pdf  
  
There should be no re-direction to any site.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
  
No, but we would like to gain such information so we may legally pursue this individual. GLENWING is the only contact.  
  
He's been in contact with an writer from tech-news.
