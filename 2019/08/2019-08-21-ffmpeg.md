I am a [private] of FFmpeg, a universal multimedia transcoding tool and one of the copyright owners.   
The website of FFmpeg is https://ffmpeg.org the current source code can be found at http://git.videolan.org/?p=ffmpeg.git and a mirror at https://github.com/ffmpeg/ffmpeg  
  
The two files hosted on the following page on github contain binaries based on FFmpeg souce code compiled under the GPL but not complying with (all of) GPL requirements for distribution, the source code for the prores_amcdx encoder is missing:   
https://github.com/da8eat/ffmpeg_prores_encoder/tree/master/build  
  
I am not aware of other forks.  
  
The best solution for the copyright infringement that I see would be the release of the source code for the prores_amcdx encoder under a compatible license, only the second best solution would be to remove the binaries. Making the repository private would not be a solution afaict, as that would mean some people could still download the copyright-infringing binaries.
