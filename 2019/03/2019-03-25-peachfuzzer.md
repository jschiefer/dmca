**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**   

Yes, we are a software development studio, and this account belongs to a former employee, containing code that belongs to us and to our clients, created as work for hire, that should not be publicly accessible. I have contacted [private], the employee, and he is unable to get into the account because it is secured via 2FA with a device he no longer has access to. So together we agreed that submitting the DMCA takedown notice would be a reasonable next step.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   

The Analytico Cleaners app source code: https://github.com/ktrumble/analytico-cleaners   
The GeneralUI.com site code https://github.com/ktrumble/generalui-com   
The PeachFuzzer website code: https://github.com/ktrumble/peachfuzzer  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

Each of the full repositoriesl should be taken down:  
https://github.com/ktrumble/analytico-cleaners   
https://github.com/ktrumble/generalui-com   
https://github.com/ktrumble/peachfuzzer  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes, there appear to be none.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

No.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

Making the repositories private would be fine, but [private] says he no longer has access to this account.  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

[private]
