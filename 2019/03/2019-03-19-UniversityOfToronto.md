**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**   
Yes: I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I am [private] for the undergraduate Computer Security course ([private]) at the University of Toronto. The following repositories consist largely of the work that I created in generating the lab assignments for this course. I have not granted permission for my code to be distributed in this manner. As the clearest example of infringement, my name appears in an authorship note in the top of the following files:

With very few exceptions, the other files in these repositories all appear to be either directly authorized by me, or directly derived from work directly authored by me.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

All of these repositories must be taken down entirely. While I have provided a single example of infringement in each of the repositories, the majority of each of these repositories is either my own work, or files that are directly derived from my own work without attribution or permission.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have attempted to search for forks; the ones I have located, to date, are included in the above list.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No: the infringed work has never been licensed under open-source. It is my own work, and has never been authorized for public release.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

No: I am unwilling to license any of my work to support the purpose of these repositories (which appears to be solely to enable students to cheat on their coursework).

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I do not, but would be interested in receiving it.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."**

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
