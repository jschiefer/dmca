Copyright owner

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The [CKs-FilterList-Mirror repository](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList-Mirror) of [CHEF-KOCH](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH) violates the MIT license of [WindowsSpyBlocker repository](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker). As the license stipulates, a copy of the license and copyright notice must be included.

Instead of that, he plagiarizes and passes off my work as his own :

https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList-Mirror/blob/master/hosts/Windows%2010.txt

is a verbatim copy of :

https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/blob/master/data/hosts/extra.txt   
https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/blob/master/data/hosts/spy.txt   
https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/blob/master/data/hosts/update.txt

**This repository was created without scruples following this [previous DMCA notice](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/03/2019-03-05-WindowsSpyBlocker.md) for the same content.**

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The following file should be deleted https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList-Mirror/blob/master/hosts/Windows%2010.txt or my license and a copyright notice should be included within this file.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Violation of [MIT license](https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/blob/master/LICENSE). As stipulated before, the following file should be deleted https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList-Mirror/blob/master/hosts/Windows%2010.txt or my license and a copyright notice should be included within this file. Instead of that, he plagiarizes and [passes off my work as his own](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList-Mirror/blob/master/hosts/Windows%2010.txt).

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

This is the second time I create a DMCA takedown notice for this user and this repository. On the newly created repository he added a note in the [README](https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList-Mirror/commit/2e0579bb2daa82dcb7fdbeb09777da3b00f17250#diff-1e290ac8433d555bce009b162cb869d0) about the previous DMCA takedown in violation of your TOS [again](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2019/03/2019-03-05-WindowsSpyBlocker.md) ([appendix D](https://help.github.com/en/articles/github-terms-of-service#d-user-generated-content)) :

``` 
### What happened to the original list CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList?

I got [copyright trolled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_troll) by crazy-max and I refused to accept the changes the so called "owner" offered me:

> The following file should be deleted 
> https://github.com/CHEF-KOCH/CKs-FilterList/blob/master/HOSTS/Windows%2010.txt 
> or my license and a copyright notice should be included within this file.

Which means GitHub locked the original repo, crazy-max does not have any copyright for _MS telemetry related domains_ which are visible to everyone via Whireshark/DNSQuerySniffer. The domains are also official mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/compat/deploy-telemetry-dashboard) and I investigate them way longer (everyone knows that) - maybe since 2015 back in my MDL days.

Since I know who is behind all this I also filled in a DMCA takedown request against [private] for harassment and disinformation regarding my person, work and repositories. The full story will be uploaded (by GitHub) [here](https://github.com/github/dmca).

It's a shame that I have to waste my free time with these trolls.

The behaviour of @CHEF-KOCH should be stopped **once and for all** for the sake of the open source community. Please see:
