**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**   
I am contacting you on behalf of Crisp Thinking Ltd, where I am [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   
An interview candidate has uploaded the questions and answers to part of our interview process to a public repository. The candidate will have received a standard disclaimer with the test stating that our questions and their answers are copyright to Crisp Thinking.

https://github.com/backenddeveloper/ForCrisp

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**   
https://github.com/backenddeveloper/ForCrisp

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have found no forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The uploader has added a GPL license into the repository, we do not believe this has a legal basis.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We would accept the repository being made private. Our main objective is to ensure that future interview candidates are providing their own work, not a copy from a public repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

There is insufficient information on his account to identify contact information, but based on the test results we have recorded, I believe these answers were provided by [private] in October 2015.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**
