**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  
Yes, I'm [private] of the ICS_SCAN Project. My account name is [private] when I push the project as a master, but recently, I have changed my name to [private] because the press to me. I delete the master and the first fork of my ICS_SCAN become the master. Maybe you can find that what I say is true in my history operations.  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
I pushed my ICS_SCAN in June,2018, I cannot remember clearly about the exact time. And many people forked the ICS_SCAN. But recently, my company tell me that the code is a secret project and they will abuse me if I donnot get the code down. I first make the project to private. Then I donnot keep it, so I delete the project. But I find the first fork became the master, so the code canbe found in the internet even I delete my code. And there are many forks of my ICS_SCAN. I beg you to help me to delete all the forks, because I donnot want to the code spread in the internet, Or I will be abused.
Before I rename my account and delete the respo, the URL is [private], now I delete it, this become 404. Maybe you can confirm it by check the history. Thank you. And I am really nervous about it.
