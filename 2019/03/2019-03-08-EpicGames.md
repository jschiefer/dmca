**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**   
Yes, I, [private], am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is being infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   
Epic Games, Inc. (“Epic”) has created and licenses the proprietary video game software known as Fortnite (http://www.epicgames.com/fortnite). In addition to Epic’s copyright in Fortnite, Epic has registered the Fortnite mark (registration numbers: 4481629 and 5375076, among others), and has various common law trademark rights related to Fortnite (collectively, “Intellectual Property Rights”).

Additionally, Epic Games, Inc. is the sole owner of the copyright to “Fortnite” in accordance with Title 17 of the U.S. Code. Thus, Epic Games possesses the exclusive right to reproduce, modify, post, and/or distribute those materials or to grant others permission to exercise one or more of those rights. Epic Games highly values our intellectual property, because it is an extremely important component of our business and overall success. Specifically, the software items at issue infringe upon enable unauthorized access to Epic's copyrighted material, and thus constitutes contributory and/or induce copyright infringement.

The fnpaktrack repository contains extracted content from encrypted config and ini files for Fortnite. Under normal circumstances, Fortnite users do not have access to this information. The posting of these files demonstrates that the owner of this repository has the ability to bypass Epic's encrypted files and is making our copywritten material available to anyone who has knowledge of this link.

Specifically, these files are circumventing access control of our copywritten source material. They are opening a container (.pak) file protected with an AES key to obtain these files. We do not distribute these files individually to end users, instead we distribute the pak file and the game process uses the AES key to load the files in the game. While the game is running, the users have reverse engineered our product to look at process memory in order to obtain the AES key. The files contained are content files, including art and configuration files, that are used by Fortnite clients and all content contained within the pak file was created by Epic Games as part of a copywritten work.

We respectfully request, therefore, that the content be removed.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
