Hello Dear Github:  
     My name is [private].I am [private] of Southwest University of Finance and Economics.It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform,and now I have need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.  
     have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.  
    I created a Repository called "Clustering" in [private],contained many clustering algorithms and some of the contents is innovative.I found before I set this Repository private,the user named Pickwolf and pra1981 completely forked my entire Repository,and it still exists.  
    The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about my forked Repository:  
https://github.com/pra1981/Clustering

https://github.com/Pickwolf/Clustering

    Since "Clustering" contain important source code,algorithm,so I hope Github as soon as possible to help me completely remove the Repository in Pickwolf and pra1981's account.
