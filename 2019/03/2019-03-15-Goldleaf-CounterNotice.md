Counter-Notice

I am contesting this DMCA takedown notice,  there is no code from goldleaf inside of my binaries, and the dmca notice offers no proof of such an act.

Identify the content that was disabled and the location where it appeared:  
https://github.com/digableinc/tinfoil  
https://github.com/blawar/lithium

Provide your contact information:

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

Signed,
