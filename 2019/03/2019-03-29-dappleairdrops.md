**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?** 


I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**


The work which has been infringed is the full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of the Dapple Airdrops website: 

https://www.dappleairdrops.com/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The infringed work exists on the following website which is hosted on GitHub: https://www.qunfaba.com/. All the code is copy pasted from the Dapple Airdrops website.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.** 

The original copyrighted files are not on GitHub. No other repositories have been identified to have infringed the copyrighted work.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?** 

The original copyrighted work is not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?** 

The best solution would be for the website to be taken down as all the source code has just been copy pasted. There is no original work, other than a slight redesign on the logo and all the content translated to Chinese.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:** 

No.
