Please note that there is our similar takedown notice -   https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/e1a9cecbc92d4c0344065ae136dd10ffb6883ee2/2018/2018-07-17-InspireUI.md. This is not our first time for the takedown as our company should searching Github repo infringing every month to find out our purchased customer to create Github public repo.  


**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
I have found this fork from the react-native-wordpress

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
Please help to remove these repos  

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
Sorry, I don't have.
