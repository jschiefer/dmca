**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   

The original work has been used in a software engineering class at the Technical University of Munich and consists of PDF slides with teaching material and exercise with source code. Usage of the material was limited to the students of the course. The students of the course were clearly told that they are not allowed to publish the slides and the source code of the exercises. The copyright infringer published everything on Github without telling us and without our consent. The copyright infringer took screenshots of PDF slides and cut out the copyright statement.  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

The whole repository https://github.com/togiberlin/java_design_pattern_koans and all of its forks have to be taken down (see below)  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes, all forks of https://github.com/togiberlin/java_design_pattern_koans contain the copyrighted material and have to be taken down as well:
