I am the owner of the https://github.com/yuvadm/tiva-c/ repo which was 
taken down by a false claim.  

This repo has nothing to do with the alleged claim regarding some font, 
except for sharing the same name.  

This looks like a mistake or a blatant misunderstanding of the repo 
contents.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that 
the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or 
misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.  

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial 
district in which my address is located (if in the United States, 
otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), 
and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the 
DMCA notification or an agent of such person.  

I confirm reading
