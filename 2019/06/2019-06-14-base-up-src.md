I created a repository/project(name is "base-up-src") 3 years ago, and pushed some sensitive content to it accidentally. And later I realized this problem and try to delete the project, but I found that my repository was forked by two other people, or maybe machines. I try to contact them, but I failed. The original repository I created was deleted by myself 2 years ago, so I can't provide it's URL, but you can check commit logs of these forked reposities, all of these commit's author is my account: [private].  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
I want to completely remove these two following repositories:  
https://github.com/dragonahao/base-up-src  
https://github.com/kavinwang/base-up-src

I only found two forked repositories I comment above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**
