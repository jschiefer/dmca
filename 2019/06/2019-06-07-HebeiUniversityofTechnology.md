Hello Dear Github:

 

We are Hebei University of Technology. It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github’s support and resolution.

 

We have read and understand github’s guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

 

Our University created a Repository called “ZhongHaiYouSystem”  and “ZhongHaiYouSystemNew” in [private] 3 years ago.

Which contained creators,contents and document are all owned by the Hebei University of Technology.later found that before we deleted, the user named hongweichang zimengyu1992 , weimingtom ,jaychouzzk completely forked our entire Respository, and it still exists.

The following is Github’s URL and screenshorts about our forked Respository:

https://github.com/hongweichang/ZhongHaiYouSystemNew

https://github.com/hongweichang/ZhongHaiYouSystem

https://github.com/jaychouzzk/ZhongHaiYouSystem

https://github.com/weimingtom/ZhongHaiYouSystemNew

https://github.com/zimengyu1992/ZhongHaiYouSystemNew 

The following screenshots could prove that we are the creators of the program.

We can provide the GitHub account and password of the creator of the repository.

Since “ZhongHaiYouSystemNew” and “ZhongHaiYouSystem” contains the University’s important source code , document and algotithm, belonging to the University’s internal data assets, so we hope Github as soon as  possible to help us completely remove “ZhongHaiYouSystemNew” and “ZhongHaiYouSystem” and thank you very much!
