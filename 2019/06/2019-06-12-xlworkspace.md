Hello Dear Github:

it is nice to be able to user github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get github support and resolution.

we have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Our company's independently developed projects：” xlworkspace”。 I uploaded it to github's own warehouse and was cloned by a user named "foxhack"。Here are the cloned items from my website. In the following figure, you can see the start of the repositorie  "[private]".

URL: https://github.com/foxhack/xlworkspace.git

Now the company has found that the project should be deleted completely and the infringement should be stopped. It is hoped that GitHub will take measures. Completely deleted。

 

Here is my contact information.:

Company name：Jiangxi Bowei New Technology Co., Ltd.

My email: [private]

telephone number : [private]

Company address：Bowei Building, Nanchang Hig-tech Zone, Jiangxi Province

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

Also include the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."

I hope your can reply. Thank you.
