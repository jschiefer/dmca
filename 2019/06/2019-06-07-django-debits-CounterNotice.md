I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.

Counternotice on https://github.zendesk.com/attachments/token/oyXq3gUnbCr6kqaV6o5Gvswog/?name=2019-05-30-django-debits.md for https://github.com/vporton/django-debits

All the takedown notice is a lie from the first word to the last. I am the only writer and a copyright owner of django-debits.

I know who submitted the takedown notice: It is [private] user of GitHub, [private].

He is revenging for my takedown notice on our joint project arcamens which he illegally published. (Note that later I allowed him to publish it and asked you to remove the takedown notice.)

[private] is revenging also that I stopped to send him money as I used for about a year or more for him not to die of hunger. I can't save every angry idiot, who decided better to die of hunger than to collaborate with me.

You also can browse the history and see that I am the only committer of django-debits. [private] will surely lie that he is another author.

He hates my Debits project so much that after I added it to our joint project arcamens (another repo at GitHub now), he removed it back and wrote his own primitive and buggy replacement for no reasons (also telling that he does not understand my code). [private]'s replacement of django-debits was called by him paybills.
Note about "[private]" repo: By his stupidity [private] decided to remove the history of arcamens and create the repo anew. So it probably does not contain my commits despite it has my code. You can check that "arcamens" history starts with a big codebase not a small codebase what proves that the history was removed.

Arcamens was written jointly by me and [private]. [private] wrote most of the code but there is some my code there too. I have also helped in testing and deployment of arcamens and other software related and other work, funded the project. We initially agreed that it was our joint project with no specific copyright conditions, so the copyright of arcamens should be considered joint of me and [private]. I remind that django-debits has no single line of code by any other person than myself.
Don't believe [private].

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the Northern District of California where GitHub is located, and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
