I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  
I am [private] of the Vancouver Community Network which is the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
We have a proprietary web application that's live at https://www.streetmessenger.io/. We no longer use GitHub but the old private repository is located at [private].

The whole repository was copied and made public. I'm assuming it was from a contractor that made a mistake. Our NDA states the contractor needs to keep everything confidential. Contractors would have been given access to the repository to make commits directly.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
https://github.com/webpro125/messame

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
There are no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
Removal of the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
No. It was probably a contractor we hired but I don't recognize the user name.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
