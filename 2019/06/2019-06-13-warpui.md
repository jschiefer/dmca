I uploaded this plugin in github before and removed it and make it private. The plugin was spreaded before I've deleted it so I can stop people from spreading and but I still don't like it to see on github with Other Names. Recently I updated it and make a video and posted on my GF channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWSFU19Ns90
