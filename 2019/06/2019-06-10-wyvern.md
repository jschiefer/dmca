**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?** 

I am the copyright owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.** 

A majority of the code was written by [private], and [private] were tasked with completion of the software.   
The person that has infringed the copyright designed parts of the user interface in the conception stage, but never wrote any code.

The Software was put on a marketplace website and has since been disabled as one of the authors have been banned https://www.gmodstore.com/market/view/5626 

Please note you might be unable to access this without logging into the site as the script has been disabled as previously mentioned, therefore I have linked several pictures below. It's also noteworthy to mention that the person infringing the copyright is not listed as an author on the marketplace.
