Hello Github team,
    
I have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.

"utilities" is my github project. I upload to github wrongly with some sensitive data.Couple weeks ago my repo was flagged by CBRC(China Banking Regulatory Commission) as potential risks because of some sensitive informations involved, due to the violation of NDA i have deleted the repo on May 10,2019. 

I have searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories and found one https://github.com/cczj2010/utilities/ , To avoid future security audit from CBRC, i need to take down this fork project as well .
    
My work is not under any open source license, just a private repo but forget to set PRIVATE.   
    
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
