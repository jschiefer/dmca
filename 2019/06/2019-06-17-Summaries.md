I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.    

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  
Last night, my teammate accidentally published our commercial website (company has been going for 25 years at summaries.com) and assets as a public GIT repo -- instead of a private repo. By the time we realized the repo was public and deleted it, github user PfGBM8 had forked the repo.  

I am emailing on my teammate's behalf since English is not his first language.  

My teammate and I are the owners of the website code, and the founder of summaries.com owns most of the assets that were included with the code.  

My teammate deleted his copy of the repo: [private]

The user who forked our repo is: https://github.com/PfGBM8/summaries.com-sample-code

What can be done to prevent this code spreading further?
