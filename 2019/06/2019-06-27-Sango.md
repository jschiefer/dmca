I mean, I am exactly [private] of this README and the owner of sango-theme.    
    
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**    
    
This repository includes my work.     
https://github.com/mokuhara/stick_geinavi    
    
This is a WordPress site repository and it includes my private work (I am selling the source code, assets, and images). I guess it is unintentional.    
    
The problem is this directory.     
https://github.com/mokuhara/stick_geinavi/tree/master/themes/sango-theme     
"sango-theme" is my work and I own the copyright for this.    
    
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**    
    
Just the directory below.     
https://github.com/mokuhara/stick_geinavi/tree/master/themes/sango-theme    
    
Since I sell it for developers, source code must not be shown even in previous commits or branches.    
    
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**    
    
I searched and found no forks.    
    
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**    
    
They are in violation of the license.    
    
README refers to the license. "copyright of CSS, Javascript and some of images belongs to saruwakakun.com) [private] "https://github.com/mokuhara/stick_geinavi/blob/master/themes/sango-theme/readme.txt    
    
It definitely includes my copyrighted works.    
    
Here is the license page which users needs to confirm before payment.     
https://saruwakakun.com/sango/term    
    
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**    
    
The best solution is to make this repository private so that others can not refer it.    
    
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**    
    
No, I don't.    
    
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
