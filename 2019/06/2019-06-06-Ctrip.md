Dear GitHub DMCA Agent:

 

I am from Ctrip Computer Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., and our team found some repositories in GitHub that infringed the copyright of our company.

 

We have tried to send emails to the infringers to delete from GitHub, but we have not yet received any reply. We have to send this email and wish GitHub help us resolve this problem ASAP.

 

 

Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?

 

Yes, Ctrip Information Security Department is authorized by top management to deal with security issues including trade secret and proprietary information protection incident response in corporate level.

 

Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.

What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository's URL:

 

https://github.com/BigKam/Learnings

https://github.com/mt830813/code

 

Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.

 

We have searched and not found any forks at this moment.

 

Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?

 

No.

 

What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?

 

The best solution would be removal.

 

Do you have the alleged infringer's contact information? If so, please provide it:
