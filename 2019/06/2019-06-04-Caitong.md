Hello dear Github:  
I am [private].It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficent platfrom,and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.  
I have read and understand Github's Guide to filling a DMCA notice.

I'm an employee of Caitong Securities Company. I uploaded a company code, namely [private]t, which violates the company system. Now I'm asked to delete it. But I found that hevily fork my project (https://github.com/hevily/appsupport) before, and worse, I couldn't contact him.


Since "appsupport" contains the company's important source code,algorithm and system configuration information,belonging to the company's internal data assets,so I hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove https://github.com/hevily/appsupport and thank you very much.

The following is my contact information:
