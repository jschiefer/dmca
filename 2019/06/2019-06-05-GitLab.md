**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The content in question is a license for GitLab Enterprise Edition (EE) - which the repository this request is being submitting against is acting as a circumvention-tool, generating valid GitLab EE license keys. The proprietary license is mentioned under GitLab's licensing model, described here https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/ and the EE license, which can be found here https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ee/blob/master/LICENSE. Technical measures, including generating and validating a key using asymmetric cryptographic measures are in place.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

https://github.com/hadesy/gitlab-license

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Forks in violation upon review:

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work that is being infringed upon under the DMCA circumvention-tool provisions is covered under GitLab's proprietary license mentioned above. The script (a PHP ported version of https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/gitlab-license/1.0.0) is covered under MIT licensing - but it also not following these licensing terms (per https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). As a derivative work it should be distributed with a copy of the MIT license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The line(s) providing directions to generate a valid GitLab EE license key (specifically targeting) are what makes this repository and subsequent forks in violation under the DMCA circumvention-tool provisions. Removal of these lines, and addition of proper MIT licensing requirements (as noted at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) would get these repositories in compliance. If this is not possible, the best solution is for removal of these repositories.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No - the user's GitHub profile can be found at https://github.com/hadesy.
