Hello dear Github:   
I am [private] .It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficent platfrom,and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.   
I have read and understand Github's Guide to filling a DMCA notice.

I'm an developer of Company. I uploaded a company code, namely redcore-browser, which violates the company system. Now I'm asked to delete it. But I found that [private] fork my project (https://github.com/rootmelo92118/redcore-browser) before, and worse, I couldn't contact him.

Since "redcore-browser" contains the company's important source code,algorithm and system configuration information,belonging to the company's internal data assets,so I hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove https://github.com/rootmelo92118/redcore-browser and thank you very much.
