Hello Dear Github：    
    
It’s nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github’s support and resolution.    
    
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.    
    
I uploaded a repository called “qualitysystem” in early February 2018. My repo was flagged by CSG as potential risks because of some sensitive informations involved, due to the violation of NDA i have deleted the repo on June 13,2019.    
    
I have searched for any clone repos of the allegedly infringing files or repositories and found two https://github.com/Catfeeds/qualitysystem and https://github.com/github188/qualitysystem , To avoid future security audit from CSG, i need to take down this clone project as well .    
    
The following is Github’s URL and Screenshots about the cloned repositories：    
1) https://github.com/Catfeeds/qualitysystem published by Catfeed    
URL about my commit info: https://github.com/Catfeeds/qualitysystem/commits/master     
2) https://github.com/github188/qualitysystem published by github188    
URL about my commit info: https://github.com/github188/qualitysystem/commits/master    
All the links above contain my user's [private] first commit.

My work is not under any open source license, just a private repo but forget to set PRIVATE.     
    
I hope Github help us completely remove them as soon as possible.Thank you very much!
