Hello Dear Github:

I'm a developer of the Github named [private]. It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Last year, I commit the config file of the mongodb system as a mistake. But at that time, I do not realize it. In the days after, the repository has been forked 11 times.

June 23, I realized the mistake (the wrong commit ) and setted the “[private]” private privilege to avoid loss.

Due to the Github fork policy, setting the repository private may lost all the forkers and the second fork repository may be the first repository now.

The repository current url address: (private) [private]

I commit all of the codes, and I have the record of changing the repository private.
The commit details links: (https://github.com/zixuedanxin/bigdata/commits). I think it can prove that I'm the real copyright owner of the repository.

Now, I hope Github as soon as possible to help me completely remove the following repositories (which fork my config file) and thank you very much!

The forked repositories are as followes:  

* zixuedanxin/bigdata (https://github.com/zixuedanxin/bigdata)   
* guomaofeng/bigdata (https://github.com/guomaofeng/bigdata)
