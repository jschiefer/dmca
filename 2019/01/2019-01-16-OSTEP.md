I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Owner.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

http://www.ostep.org

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

https://github.com/huangtao00/OSTEP  
https://github.com/arafiei/OSTEP  
https://github.com/Ericyuanhui/OSTEP  
https://github.com/heha37/OSTEP  
https://github.com/S-YOU/OSTEP  
https://github.com/scott0000/OSTEP  
https://github.com/sw1001/OSTEP  
https://github.com/VitaliiAtamanchuk/OSTEP  
https://github.com/yanggang59/OSTEP

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This request is a result of [private] (GitHub staff) pointing out forks from a previous DMCA request (which was processed - thank you!). [private] suggested that if these were the same material - they seem to be - that I just do one more request with all of the forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, it is just a copyrighted book.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Removal - the website makes the book chapters available for free to download and use,
but not distribute.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."**

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Please confirm that you have you have read our Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice: https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/**

I have (as per the sentence at the top).
