Dear abuse team,  
 
This is a notification of copyright infringement.

I have a good faith belief that it is not authorized by the copyright owner,
its agent, or the law.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in the notification is
accurate and that it is authorized to be infringed.  
 
We found cases of copyright infringements on the pages below:

Original Work: Taiko no Tatsujin (https://taiko-ch.net/)

Infringing URL: [1]https://github.com/bui/taiko-web

The reported projects recreated the game owned by our client into a web
version while using the name, sounds and images from it. On top, they link to
the website where they run this web game.

The usage of the property was not authorized by our client, therefore the
whole project is illegal.

I would like to thank you very much, we would be grateful if you could send me
a message when you have accomplished the deletion.

Best regards,  
[private]
