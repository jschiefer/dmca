Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?  

Answer: I want to dispute the notice.  

Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)  

1. I'm the owner of skypool and skypool-nimiq-miner, this repo is a blockchain project `Nimiq` mining client, and I'm the owner of one of the biggest Nimiq pools `skypool`. This repo is our mining client source code and binary release package for miners. We are the first pool of Nimiq, and the repo is start from 23 Jan 2018 as commit log.  
2. The takedown notice sender `[private]` is another Nimiq pool, they are our opponent of mining pool, and they try to attack and make trouble to us everywhere, their takedown notice is just another attack.  
3. They said we use their copyright code, that's not true. They want to take down our https://github.com/skypool-org/skypool-nimiq-miner/releases/tag/v1.3.3 , this release time is 13 Sep 2018, far before their closed source software release. It's impossible for us to using their code and release those packages before they release a closed source software.  
4. Their organization is not open source and few repo stars (https://github.com/sushipool), and when we develop the GPU clients, they haven't release their software. And there is no way for me to get their closed source code, so they said we use their copyright code is not true.  
5. Our software using websocket protocol by ourselves, the protocol first version is early 2018, at that time they haven't appear, the software is totally written by us.
