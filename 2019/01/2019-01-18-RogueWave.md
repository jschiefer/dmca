To whom it may concern:

Our firm represents Rogue Wave Software, Inc. (“Rogue Wave”) in connection with intellectual property matters. We write on behalf of Rogue Wave to request that GitHub immediately remove the infringing content located at https://github.com/anjia0532/lua-jrebel-license-server.

Rogue Wave is the largest independent provider of cross-platform software development tools and embedded components in the world. Among Rogue Wave’s development tools is JRebel, a Java virtual machine plugin, which is designed to speed up the development of Java applications. Further information about JRebel is available on the Rogue Wave website located at: https://www.roguewave.com/resources/datasheets/jrebel. Rogue Wave owns all right, title, and interest in and to the JRebel software, including all copyrights.

Rogue Wave recently became aware that GitHub is hosting instructions and code that allow users to circumvent JRebel’s license protection mechanism. Use of the JRebel software in this manner constitutes infringement of Rogue Wave’s exclusive rights to reproduce and distribute the software. 17 U.S. Code § 106. In addition, these contents, collectively, constitute technology “primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing a technological measure that effectively controls access to a work protected,” in violation of the anti-circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. § 1201(a)(2)(A). Accordingly, we request that GitHub immediately remove all content from the identified URL.

As counsel for Rogue Wave I represent that I have a good faith belief that the use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. I further confirm that I have read GitHub’s Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.
