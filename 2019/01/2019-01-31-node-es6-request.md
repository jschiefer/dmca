**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  

Yes, I am the copyright owner. I wrote the entirety of the code in the original repository.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

The original copyrighted work is a HTTP(s) library wrapper around the Node.js built-in HTTP(s) libraries, making it easier to use them.  

The original work is and always has been hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/alexrsagen/node-es6-request  

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

- https://github.com/rubix-code/es6-request  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes, and there are several normal GitHub forks that are not infringing on the copyright terms.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

The work is licensed under the open source MIT license. The infringing files are in violation of the license, specifically the attribution clause, as they no longer include the name of the copyright owner (me).

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

I would naturally be satisfied if the infringer would make the necessary changes to no longer infringe upon the terms of the MIT license, and if possible, clearly indicate that it is not their original work, as the repository has not been forked, but rather reuploaded and made to seem like their own work.

However, it does seem that the infringer's intention was to make it seem like they are the copyright owner, so the best course of action if the requested changes are not possible would be to remove their repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

The infringer's GitHub profile is https://github.com/rubix-code

I have found no other means of contacting the infringer.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."**  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
