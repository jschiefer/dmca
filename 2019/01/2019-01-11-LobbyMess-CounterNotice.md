**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  
Yes, I do believe that the material was removed as a result of a mistake because of the following:  
⚫Ideas aren't copyrighted when they're not claimed as a patent and also [private] (the complaining party) copied this idea from a guy named [private] which had this plugin (the software) up first for free [private].  
⚫[private] claimed that we used the same name as his company's name, the name avi has been used before a multiple times around the internet (guess what: it's used by Microsoft) and also a video format (AVI), however AVI isn't a registered trademark or business in the U.S or anywhere else in the world.  
⚫For softwares to be copyrighted they need to copy actual code from other software which we didn't do, our code is pure and not cracked or decompiled and if it's otherwise then any second program in Github is copied (Ideas aren't copied when they're not registered).
