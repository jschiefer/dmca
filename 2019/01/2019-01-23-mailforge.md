I am the rightfull owner.

This user have posted our entire source code on his Github page found here:     https://github.com/expertdeveloperit/mailforge  
This is the backend code to our platform on https://mailforge.io and needs to be taken down right away. This developer worked with us for about a week and failed to provide results, and now our code is public.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
I do not believe this repo have been forked.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
No license, its our own code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
A simple takedown of the repo is enough for us.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
No i dont
