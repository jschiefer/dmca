**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

The repository at https://github.com/qboticslabs/school contains an archive of my personal school files. These include solutions to current courses at Duke University, and students are using these solutions for academic integrity violations.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

Solution guides are specifically at https://github.com/qboticslabs/school/tree/master/duke/cs260 but I would like to request that the entire repository be deleted as the projects themselves may be used improperly in other courses as well.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

None found at this point.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

The projects are not licensed under any license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

I would like to request that the repository be deleted as I do not intend for these projects to be shared.
