I hold a legal license to the fonts in question for web usage, invoiced by Monokrom.no (the font foundry): #1212200029 dated 20 December 2012. I am permitted 500k pageviews/month for each of Aften Screen Regular, Italic, Bold, and Small Caps.

I suspect the issue here is that the 3rd party scanning for usage of these files is not aware of the fact that I hold a legal license to this usage.

The repository in question is also the actual website, as I use GitHub pages to serve the content. As such, the actual font files must be part of the repository in order to be served to browsers. Hiding the repository would be meaningless, as anyone who connects to the resulting site and asks for the fonts would need the actual fonts transmitted to the browser in order to display them. Thus, anyone could trivially acquire the fonts for themselves simply by accessing the website.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
