**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**     
     
yes, Odoo Proprietary License v1.0 (OPL-1)     
     
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**     
     
Better to make all repository down if they have valid purchase license they can put in their private repository anytime. If they have bought apps from odoo store then can redownload and put in their private github repository.     
     
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
