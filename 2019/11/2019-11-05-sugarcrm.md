Hello, I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. Per the terms of this notice, I am filing a notice to remove the following repositories:  

[private] repository owned by [private] and the forked repository https://github.com/scoutman57/sugar761-ent owned by [private] contain our proprietary source code.  

The source code in these repositories represents our commercial Sugar Enterprise product and the copyright is owned by SugarCRM, Inc. where I serve as [private]. Both users should immediately remove the repositories and delete all local copies of the source code.  

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  

Thank you  
[private]
