**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I'm the [private] of the game, and I'm authorized to act in the game's name.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
It's a animal based MMORPG, named "FeralHeart". Our official website is "https://feral-heart.com".  
It was released in 2011, and in it the player can play as canines or felines.  
It's written in C++, using Ogre3D as it's rendering engine and RakNet for networking.  
We use CodeBlocks as IDE.  
  
The game's source is hosted on a private site, however, if needed I can provide proof of the original version.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
All of these versions were leaked through one friend of the original creator.  
https://github.com/jespersh/feral-heart-clone - Says it's a "clone" however, it's just a deficient version of the original ported to Visual Studio.  
https://github.com/blue-marten/BlueFH-Client - A 1-2 versions outdated copy of the original client.  
https://github.com/blue-marten/BlueFH-Server - A 1-2 versions outdated copy of the original server.  
https://github.com/blue-marten/Blue-FH-Map-Officializer-Tool - The exact copy of the tool we made for verifing official ingame maps.  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
Yes, these forks are slightly altered (and deficient as mentioned before) versions of the original:  
https://github.com/Kyokuaku/feral-heart-clone  
https://github.com/nakti/feral-heart-clone  
https://github.com/TWSICommunity/feral-heart-clone  
https://github.com/vilivi/feral-heart-clone  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
No. The game is closed source and never was intended to be released as open source.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
The removal of all repositories. These files were never intended to be released and they propose the risk of attacks against the official game in form of modified game clients. Making these repositories private won't solve the problem.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
I do not.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
