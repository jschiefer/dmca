**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

This is project code from the CS4780 Machine Learning class at Cornell University. We are still using this code for current students and it should not be posted online.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This code is used in class as part of project assignments.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/JasonHanwen/CS4780

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

no forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

no license, he should have never posted it online

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I am sure this was done accidental. [private] was a student at Cornell and used Github as a repo for his project code. So he checked everything in. I would be fine if this repo is turned private. I just don't want the other students (currently enrolled) to see the code.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I tried to contact him, but couldn't get hold of him.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
