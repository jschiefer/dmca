Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the owner of original repo of  
[private]

I have deleted the original repo a while ago, so it is very likely that you can't find it under my account. Here are the proof of my ownership  
1. Commit history  
If you take a look at [private], all the commits are from my account, including the very first commit. The first commit of a repo cannot come from people other than the owner.

2. Opeartion history  
Every operation that I have done should be logged somewhere in GitHub's database. I would suggest looking up my past commits in the database, and you'll see it's pushing to my original repo, which is [private]. You can also search for my operation of deleting the repository.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repo contains my personal information that I don't want to disclose. I have deleted my original repo, and contacted the person who forked it(fanzhongrui), she agreed to delete the repo, but since she has lost access to the account, she's unable to complete the operation.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No license

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I would like those two forks to be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Yes
