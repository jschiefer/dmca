Dear Github team,
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.
After a successful takedown notice last week against the user "notsogoodsamaritan", you have notified us that the respective repositoty has been froked under several further links, defined below.
As the Plesk [private], I represent Plesk International GmbH, [private] as the owner of all intellectual property (incl. IP in the source code, trademarks and copyrights) belonging to Plesk software products.
The obvious way such user offers his code on Github makes a direct approach of the user by Plesk obsolete.
Plesk hereby kindly requests a take-down of the Plesk crack under the aforementioned link and, if possible, a block of the originator due to the fact that he openly offers IP-infringing materials on your platform.
The Plesk Legal Department is at your disposition for further questions and is ready to provide what is required to immediately stop this infringement of Plesk's rights in its products.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringed product is Plesk software, available for licensing under www.plesk.com.
The present takedown notice is directed against a crack of our proprietary software, allowing users to use it without first obtaining a (royalty-bearing) license from Plesk.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The crack for Plesk has been forked at the following links:

https://github.com/khalequzzaman17/pleskcrack  
https://github.com/lyekumchew/pleskcrack  
https://github.com/alfonsobp15/pleskcrack

https://github.com/lyekumchew/pleskcrack  

 

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

All currently known forks are listed above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The crack is available for direct access through your platform. We are in good belief that this might be in violation of every kind of license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be a complete takedown of the code and a block of the uploading user. Making the repository private would not remedy the piracy itself.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

The Repository has been uploaded under invalid email addresses. Plesk does not have more information about the users.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
