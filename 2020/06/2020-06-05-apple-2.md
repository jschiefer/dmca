APPLE INC.’S DMCA TAKE DOWN NOTICE (CD034064)

Dear DMCA Agent:

We are outside intellectual property counsel for Apple Inc. (“Apple” or “Copyright Owner”), the owner of certain copyright protected software identified below, which has been posted to GitHub.org without license. Please direct all future correspondence related to this matter to me.

We hereby provide notice of copyright infringement pursuant to the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “Act”). 

Copyright Owner is the owner of copyrights in the following work (the “Work”):

1.                  Apple’s internal, not publicly disclosed, project file.

It has come to Copyright Owner’s attention that your service located at this repository:

1.       https://gist.github.com/noestreich/4a4c53eeb9ae4ddf7219ffb5befba15e

(the “Service") displays and provides access to the Work without license from Apple in a manner that infringes Apple’s copyright in the Works.

Our investigation confirms that this file is an Apple internal project file that is not published publicly and is considered Apple confidential material in its entirety.  Apple does not publicly disclose the details of its internal projects, of which this file is one. This file is Apple internal source code for a computer program and is protected by Apple’s copyright.

We have a good faith belief that the use of the Work in the material described in this letter is not authorized by Copyright Owner, any agent of Copyright Owner, or any applicable law.  The information in this notification is accurate. We swear under penalty of perjury that we are authorized to act on behalf of Copyright Owner with respect to the subject matter of this letter. 

We therefore request that you remove or disable access to the infringing material as set forth in Section 512(c)(1)(C) of the Act and pursuant to your Copyright Policy and terms of service.

Please contact the undersigned no later than one week from the date of this letter to confirm that the infringing materials have been removed or access disabled. The undersigned may be contacted at the address and email address set forth above.

The above is not an exhaustive statement of all the relevant facts and law. We expressly reserve all legal and equitable rights and remedies.

 

Very truly yours,
