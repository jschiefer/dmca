**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I develop this software which was illegally decompiled, so I hold copyright ownership of all the code found on this user's GitHub repository, which is why I'm requesting it to be fully removed/deleted.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This user's GitHub repository is the decompiled program I own and develop, called "AtomicProtector", which can be found for sale here, https://autobuy.io/@atomiccheats/Product/167de9fe-d018-44d5-fd75-08d7e5c49e04, and below I listed four videos I made of my software long before this repository's release.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/loaderbot1/AtomicSource-Leaked

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks, the user illegally decompiled my program, then uploaded on GitHub. You cannot find any of this code anywhere else on GitHub.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is NOT open source. This is a program developed with intentions to sell only. My terms of service found at the bottom of the description for my product https://autobuy.io/@atomiccheats/Product/167de9fe-d018-44d5-fd75-08d7e5c49e04 listing here prohibit any reverse engineering, such as cracking, or in this case, decompiling the program to the source code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The only solution I will accept is deletion of the GitHub repository in its entirety. All of the code is stolen. If you read the description of the GitHub repository, it even explains that he leaked my program's source, because he doesn't like that I am selling it. So, again, I will not tolerate my code being stolen and put on GitHub, I request that this is removed, and if possible that the code is blacklisted from being uploaded again, because I am quite confident that this user will just try to upload it again.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do, and the person refuses to remove it.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
