Hi there,

Devskiller is an automated testing platform for assessing the coding and development skills of software developers.  We provide recruiters and employers with an objective assessment of a person’s technical skills of developer candidates as well as in-house employees.

To assess technical skills, Devskiller has built and maintains a large library of coding tests that our customers can use. These are made up of partially completed projects that are completed by the test taker within a certain time limit. For the tests to be effective, the taker can not have seen the contents of the test or be able to plan a solution before the timer on the test starts.

We found this content to be a copy of a DevSkiller coding test. For our tests to be effective, test takers can’t see the test project before they start. To protect our copyright and the integrity of our tests, these projects have to be taken down:

https://github.com/williamCardenas/DrConsultaTest  


I request that you take down all the files related to these projects.

The code became available to the candidate as part of the assessment. The code is the property of the author of the Devskiller and is NOT shared under the open-source license. Before starting the test, the candidate accepted the following terms of the assessment:

"This assessment is subject to copyright protection and by accessing the assessment you are obliged to accept the following regulations:
