**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  

Yes, we (the company Vector Informatik GmbH) are the copyright holder and I am – as [private] – authorized to act for Vector Informatik GmbH in this matter.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  

Vector Informatik GmbH develops products for the development of automotive electronics. As part of our products we have a closed-source logging format called BLF. This format is created with a library from Vector called “Binlog.dll/Binlog.lib”. As we found out, this copyrighted library has been made available to the public through Github. Once along with Examples on how to use this library from our product CANoe, and once as a single library in another project from the same user.

Even if we have a very liberal license for this library, allowing our customers to use it outside of our tools in their own tools, we do not and did not allow a public distribution. If we would decide to do so, we would place it officially at https://github.com/vectorgrp

For more details about Vector see: https://www.vector.com/int/en/

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

The files in the Repository https://github.com/zhyongquan/blfdemo (except the README.md) are part of our product CANoe and therefore copyrighted by Vector Informatik.

You can verify this e.g. by the Copyright notices in https://github.com/zhyongquan/blfdemo/blob/master/VS_Project/bl.c

In the repository https://github.com/zhyongquan/pyblf the user also uses the binlog-libraries

https://github.com/zhyongquan/pyblf/blob/master/lib/binlog.dll

https://github.com/zhyongquan/pyblf/blob/master/lib/binlog.lib

 

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  

The master repository with the original upload is:

https://github.com/zhyongquan/blfdemo

We tried to contact the owner several times without any answer from his side.

In the repository https://github.com/zhyongquan/pyblf only these files:

https://github.com/zhyongquan/pyblf/blob/master/lib/binlog.dll

https://github.com/zhyongquan/pyblf/blob/master/lib/binlog.lib

The other files are actually quite nice. If one of our customers wants to use the project of the author, he could just copy the libraries to use the package from our product installation according to our terms.

But it is not possible to distribute this package with those library files under a MIT license.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Here are the additional locations where the code from https://github.com/zhyongquan/blfdemo has been forked and must be taken down:

https://github.com/aifei7320/blfdemo

https://github.com/ChrisGuyue/blfdemo

https://github.com/KDW79/blfdemo

https://github.com/kingkazu0226/blfdemo

https://github.com/telehan/blfdemo

https://github.com/wutaoo/blfdemo

As most of them do not have contact info on their pages, we could not contact them. All Repositories except https://github.com/kingkazu0226/blfdemo are identical to the master repository. The SECURITY.md file added recently in this repository is not copyrighted by us.

The repository https://github.com/zhyongquan/pyblf has been forked two times, the following files are affected:

https://github.com/CharlieForC/pyblf2asc/blob/master/lib/binlog.dll

https://github.com/CharlieForC/pyblf2asc/blob/master/lib/binlog.lib

https://github.com/wutaoo/pyblf/blob/master/lib/binlog.dll

https://github.com/wutaoo/pyblf/blob/master/lib/binlog.lib

 

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

The work is not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  

We allow companies which are our customers to use binlog.dll outside our products as long as they have a valid license for our products. Therefore, placement in a private company repository would be acceptable, but public distribution is against our licensing terms.

For the pyblf repository and its forks it would be acceptable if the author would remove the libraries and add an instruction for people to use the libraries from our product although we are not sure if this will work since the version of the libraries is rather old. But we would be open to discuss possibilities with the authors here, if they would contact us. Making the repository private under the above-mentioned licensing conditions would also be acceptable.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  

We contacted zhyongquan under [private] but as we got no reply, we are not sure if the address is correct.

 

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  

Yes.

**I have taken fair use into consideration.**  

Yes.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  

Yes.

**I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice.**  

Yes.

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
