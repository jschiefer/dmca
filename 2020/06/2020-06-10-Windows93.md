Dear Github staff,  
My name is [private] and I am a french digital artist (pseudonyme [private]) and
owner of http://windows93.net and http://jankenpopp.com  
A web page that your company hosts is infringing on at least one copyright owned by me.  
My work Windows93 has been copied onto your servers without permission. The original written
work to which we own the exclusive copyrights can be found at: http://v1.windows93.net  
The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at: https://github.com/windows93-net/v1-windows-93-repo.  
The following is a sample (and not the entirety) of the content that has been copied without
permission: view-source:http://v1.windows93.net/  
I ask you to take down the stolen source https://github.com/windows93-net/v1-windows-93-repo
and all its forks created without our authorization: https://github.com/windows93-net/v1-windows-93-repo/network/members  
Please remove as well the fake windows93 project page too: https://github.com/windows93-net
(we are not affiliated with these persons).  
This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act
(”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I
request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to
remove the infringing material immediately, and notify them to cease any further posting of
infringing material to your server in the future.  
I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing
web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I swear, under
penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright
owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly
infringed.  
Should you wish to discuss this with me please contact me directly. Thank you.
