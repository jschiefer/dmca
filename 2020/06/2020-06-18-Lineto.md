I haven't found any additional forks.

NO

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

NO, this is copyrighted software and distribution for free is damaging and threatening our small business.

NO - otherwise we would have contacted them directly.
