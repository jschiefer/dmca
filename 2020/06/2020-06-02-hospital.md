Hello, my name is [private], [private] [private] 3D artist (freelance). I'm known as "[private]" in GTA modding community.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I designed an hospital (3D assets) for my Patreon community. Someone just took it and released it for free on github. My name still appears on a lot of files names, so it shouldn't be hard to prove I'm the owner.
