Infringement Notice

Dear Sirs/Madams,

Products of our company JetBrains s.r.o., such as PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, IntelliJ
IDEA, AppCode, ReSharper, CLion,
DataGrip are proprietary desktop software products. The originals of the products can be found at
JetBrains s.r.o. official website: https://jetbrains.com.

We have been notified that cracks, instructions on how to use the cracks, activation codes, and
other methods which aim to circumvent technical measures protecting JetBrains tools from
unauthorized use are publicly accessible on your website github.com.

JetBrains protects its software tools by authorizing the users to run the tools if the user
activates the tool with either valid JetBrains account credentials or an activation code. The
credentials are for running tools online with an access to the internet, and the activation code is
for offline use, when the tools are running without an access to the internet.

The materials infringing JetBrains s.r.o. rights mentioned above are to be found in particular on
the following links:

technical measures protecting JetBrains tools from unauthorized use, such as, in particular, copies
of hosts file with disabled access to JetBrains authorized license server account.jetbrains.com, on
the website github.com to be infringement of our proprietary rights.

Please remove all materials mentioned above from the website github.com, by the links specified above.
