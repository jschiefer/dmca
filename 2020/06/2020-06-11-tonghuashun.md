My name is [private].I used to work in a Chinese company called tonghuashun（http://www.10jqka.com.cn/）.Four years agoI accidentally uploaded the company's code.After a while, the company's security team contacted me and asked me to delete these codes.I deleted the code,but the repository forked by jijiewang/tonghuashun(https://github.com/jijiewang/tonghuashun), ghbhiee / tonghuashun(https://github.com/ghbhiee/tonghuashun), itellyouwhereiam / tonghuashun(https://github.com/itellyouwhereiam/tonghuashun).  
Now, if i don't deleted those repositories the company will sue me .
