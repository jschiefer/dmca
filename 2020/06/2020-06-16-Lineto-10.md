**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Lineto GmbH are the copyright owner of the font LL Circular

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We are a Swiss Typefoundry and the owner and sole distributer of LL Circular Std and Pro (https://lineto.com/typefaces/circular?tab=about).  
They also incorrectly (!) state/claim that the font is available under Open Font License and contain a fake licence. This seems to spread like wildfire, as most contain the same fake (MIT) Licence either produced by elatrix aka Vladimir Mechkauskas or Ahmed Tarek

The Font is available as a free download on Github:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I haven't found any additional forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

NO

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

NO, this is copyrighted software and distribution for free is damaging and threatening our small business and is creating legal cases/infringement cases for third parties.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

NO - otherwise we would have contacted them directly.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
