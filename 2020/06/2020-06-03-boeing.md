Dear Sir:

I write on behalf of The Boeing Company ("Boeing"), as its duly authorized representative for the purpose of this DMCA takedown request pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง512(c)(3). It has come to our attention that Boeing's exclusive rights in its copyrighted work(s) as described below are being infringed. Specifically, Boeing's rights are infringed by the availability for viewing and downloading its copyrighted works ("the Infringing Material) accessible at the URL(s) identified below:

I have a good faith belief that Boeing has not authorized the aforementioned use of the Infringing Material.

Under penalty of perjury in a United States court of law, I state that the information contained in this notification is accurate, and that I am authorized to act on the behalf of the exclusive rights holder for the copyrighted work in question.

Accordingly, we request that you remove the Infringing Material or disable access to it immediately.

I may be contacted at the following addresses:
