Dear Github:  
I am very honored to use Github as a professional platform and benefit a lot from itï¼Œand now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.
I have read and understand Github's Guide to filling a DMCA notice.My project "underwater" was completed by our team in cooperation, and it is still in the development stage. I don't want to make it public for the time being. Due to my negligence, the repository was not made private when hosting the code on Github. When I found out, a user had already forked the project, and he did not leave contact information so I couldn't contact him. I can only ask for your help.  
This project was developed in private by our team, which contains all our algorithms and source code. We hope Github can help us completely remove "https://github.com/seatrix/underwater" as soon as possible.Thank you very much.  
The following is my contact information:
