**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm [private] of the company Smart-Tech that developed the code on https://github.com/netsmarttech/node-open-protocol and https://github.com/netsmarttech/node-red-contrib-open-protocol repositories.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Both repositories have been forked by [private] on https://github.com/jeremy-london/node-open-protocol-desoutter and https://github.com/jeremy-london/node-red-contrib-open-protocol-desoutter and many copyright, trademark and attribution notices were removed, in a violation of the Apache-2.0 license of the original work. The infringement can be seen on the following commits:

https://github.com/jeremy-london/node-open-protocol-desoutter/commit/004226e8cd4be41ade7397b3d5439941f53f999b

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/jeremy-london/node-red-contrib-open-protocol-desoutter

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Other forks of the original work don't seem to infringe the license of the original work

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license. The infringing repositories are in violation of the license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The infringing repositories could re-add the removed attribution notices, trademark and copyright of the original work; or the repository could be made private

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Unfortunately, no, only the github's username: @jeremy-london  
Issues were also disabled on the repositories, so we couldn't contact them beforehand.
