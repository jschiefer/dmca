Yes, I am the copyright holder.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I created a dataset, labelled with my name and my then place of employment. This was known as the World Phonotactics Database.

In 2019 it was brought to my attention that a [private] had posted a "ANU World Phonotactics Database" on Github, with a link to Figshare. I contacted Figshare, they investigated my statement that [private] had posted the data from my database without permission, and they removed the content. I contacted [private] first, but [private] was unwilling to cooperate. I had believed the issue was resolved with the page being removed.

A colleague has pointed out to me that [private] has posted it again:

https://gist.github.com/xflr6/800401204fe15a6d1b9289149725b790

It appears to have been most recently posted on 17 April, following the previous issues.
I would like this to be removed, and only be re-posted if I have given permission for it to be made public, which I withhold at the moment.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The dataset was hosted at the Australian National University; it is no longer there.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I do not believe there to be forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Taking down the page, and, if there are further infractions, banning [private] from posting.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Possibly

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
