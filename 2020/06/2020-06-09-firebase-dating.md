Hi,

My name is [private] and our team build and sell apps on the Envato marketplace, Codecanyon.

We have built an app to sell on the Codecanyon platform exclusively. Please check our app from here,
https://codecanyon.net/item/flirt-firebase-dating-app/23323675

But the user here, has uploaded an illegal and unlicensed copy of our work as an open source. Which we came to after we got an email from Google cloud team that a user has upload our app in his public repo. We already asked teh user to remove our content, but he denied.

All the file names, every single line of codes and functions are same and built by us with lots of hardwork, time and patience. But the above user has just uploaded it publicly and is not removing our content.

We have already reported this to the Enavto team, but they said they cannot do anything as the content is uploaded on another website. So they have asked me to contact you for removal of the app.

We are losing many sales and negative review on the Codecanyon market by users, and many users have already downloaded ait and using our apps for free on the PlayStore.

We have gone a mile of trouble to build the app, so we really request you to please remove our unlicensed apps from the users account asap.

This act of your kindness will help us continue our work peacefully, and dedicate ourselves more to the development of our apps.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Our original FireDate app is being sold here at the Envato marketplace. Please have a look at it.

And the unlicensed work has been publicly uploaded here without our permission.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The user has uploaded the entire project on his repository, so we request you to please takedown the entire repository.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have searched but there has not been any another repo to our knowledge. We came to know about this user through the google cloud mail, which said a user has uploaded our project on his public repository, and so we should look into it.

Please have a look at the google cloud mail which we received,

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. The work is not uploaded as an open source. We have just built the app ourselves and selling it on CodeCanyon market.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

It would be best if the user is asked to remove the entire repo from his account.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Sorry! We already tried hard to contact the user, be he dosent reply to our emails. We contacted him through Envato account, he has also registered on the Enavto. Please have a look at his profile.
