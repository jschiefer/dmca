APPLE INC.’S DMCA TAKE DOWN NOTICE (CD034131)

Dear DMCA Agent:

We are outside intellectual property counsel for Apple Inc. (“Apple” or “Copyright Owner”), the owner of certain copyright protected software identified below, which has been posted to GitHub.org without license. Please direct all future correspondence related to this matter to me.

We hereby provide notice of copyright infringement pursuant to the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “Act”). 

Copyright Owner is the owner of copyrights in the following work (the “Work”):

1.                  Apple’s SF Font Family

It has come to Copyright Owner’s attention that your service located at these repositories:

1.       https://github.com/auranticus/San-Francisco-family

(the “Services") displays and provides access to the Work without license from Apple in a manner that infringes Apple’s copyrights in the Works.

This repository includes a readme file that explains that this is Apple’s copyright protected material and that this person has no right to distribute Apple’s Work.  https://github.com/auranticus/San-Francisco-family/blob/master/README.md. And, this repository includes subfolders that clearly include Apple’s copyright notice, for example here (and shown in screen shot below): https://github.com/auranticus/San-Francisco-family/blob/master/README.md.



We have a good faith belief that the use of the Works in the material described in this letter is not authorized by Copyright Owner, any agent of Copyright Owner, or any applicable law.  The information in this notification is accurate. We swear under penalty of perjury that we are authorized to act on behalf of Copyright Owner with respect to the subject matter of this letter. 

We therefore request that you remove or disable access to the infringing material as set forth in Section 512(c)(1)(C) of the Act and pursuant to your Copyright Policy and terms of service.

Please contact the undersigned no later than one week from the date of this letter to confirm that the infringing materials have been removed or access disabled. The undersigned may be contacted at the address and email address set forth above.

The above is not an exhaustive statement of all the relevant facts and law. We expressly reserve all legal and equitable rights and remedies.

 

Very truly yours,

/[private]/
