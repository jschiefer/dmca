I am authorized to act on behalf of UiPath Inc. as [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

UiPath's main product is the Robotic Process Automation Platform. The Platform consists of 3 components: Studio, Robots and Orchestrator. The original copyrighted work that is infringed is UiPath Studio - a tool used for Windows desktop automation. More information on it available here: https://www.uipath.com/product/studio

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository: https://github.com/rpa-ai/RPAStudio  
The repo infringes UiPath's copyright and trade dress for the following reasons:  
Reason #1: The entire layout mimics UiPath Studio's design which is the only RPA tool on the market with this design. It can be easily confused.  
Reason #2: The capacity of distributing workflows / automations via Nuget technology is our IP and is not found in any RPA tool in the market.  
Reason #3: Grouping activities (lego pieces that perform automation) into Nuget packages is also our IP and not found in any RPA tool in the market.  
Reason #4: There is flagrant trace of code which is generated by our Studio found in the github project. (https://github.com/rpa-ai/RPAStudio/blob/master/RPAStudio/Plugins.Shared.Library/Editors/project.json)  
Reason #5: This piece of code [private] and expecially this line of code https://github.com/rpa-ai/RPAStudio/blob/b373f89647cd520037cc889ecb338f883555e42b/RPAStudio/RPARobot/Services/LoadDependenciesService.cs#L126 loads and reads project.json files. This means that it is written in such a way that enables opening projects built with UiPath Studio.  
Reason #6: This piece of code https://github.com/rpa-ai/RPAStudio/blob/master/RPAStudio/RPAStudio/DataManager/ProjectSettingsDataManager.cs is written to read projects built with UiPath, specifically breakpoints.  
Reason #7: Managing Nuget Packages which contain automations and automation activities. This is a feature only found in UiPath Studio in the RPA space.  
Reason #8: This piece of code https://github.com/rpa-ai/RPAStudio/blob/5695a1fac74d77775bf9de411afe82e232c05372/RPAStudio/RPAStudio/DataManager/ProjectSettingsDataManager.cs#L89 was written to specifically read UiPath built automations / projects. It reads the .local folder which is a folder again generated by UiPath Studio inside each UiPath Studio project.  
Reason #10: We had an exact icon for publishing like the one they use for publishing in an earlier version - Studio 18.4  
Reason #11:
https://github.com/rpa-ai/RPAStudio/blob/master/RPAStudio/RPAStudio/ViewModel/PublishProjectViewModel.cs
they have the same publishin history as UiPath  
Reason #12: Same number of tabs as UiPath Studio for grouping similar functiuonalities (Settings / Design / Debug)  
Reason #13: We had an exact same Quick tool bar in an earlier version but we removed it.
