Infringement Notice

Dear Sirs/Madams,

Products of our company JetBrains s.r.o., such as PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, IntelliJ 
IDEA, AppCode, ReSharper, CLion,
DataGrip are proprietary desktop software products. The originals of the products can be found at 
JetBrains s.r.o. official website: https://jetbrains.com.

We have been notified that cracks, instructions on how to use the cracks, activation codes, and 
other methods which aim to circumvent technical measures protecting JetBrains tools from 
unauthorized use are publicly accessible on your website github.com.

JetBrains protects its software tools by authorizing the users to run the tools if the user 
activates the tool with either valid JetBrains account credentials or an activation code. The 
credentials are for running tools online with an access to the internet, and the activation code is 
for offline use, when the tools are running without an access to the internet.

The materials infringing JetBrains s.r.o. rights mentioned above are to be found in particular on
the following links:
