**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This reported repository is infringing the end user licence agrement for using my website www.marcophono.com  
-> https://www.marcophono.com/copyright.html  
The reported content is offering a javascript code for injection into my website's DOM to bypass the technical restriction of my website's usage.  
To start a phone call from my website the user enters a phone call number. In a second step a Javascript function asks my server if the user is allowed to call that number and if that number is allowed to be called (emergency phone numbers are blocked by default for example). The request works with a Ajax request to a php script while overgiving the phone number and user id as GET parameters.
The reported project bypasses this filter. The reported projects offers a Javascript code which manipulates the process structure of my Javascript code. Instead of requesting a "go" or "no go" from my server the script provides my Javascript function for starting the call with a "go".
