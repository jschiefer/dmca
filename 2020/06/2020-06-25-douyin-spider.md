**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
Yes, I searched through github and found a project that was cloned from my project and re-pushed to his own repo (not using github fork)：  
- https://github.com/xl5555123/douyin_spider  
  
The above project has been forked by many people again. So I am very upset now. I hope to delete this re-pushed project and those forked project. Like:

I wish to delete all copies of my project from github.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
The work is not going to be open source now, so the open source agreement is not included in the README.  
I really like github and hope to use github as the online repository for this project.  
But due to my personal negligence, it was not set as a private repo after pushing. So I am very anxious now. please help me!  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
1. remove from github  
2. can not  
3. cannot be converted to private  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
