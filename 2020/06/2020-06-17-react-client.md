**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the owner of this repository: [private]. The only developer that worked on it.
On June 3rd 2020, I saw this user: https://github.com/luckdev000 not only copying my repository to his account but also changing all the commits username to his username.
You can see when he did so on his contribution activity and here's is the repository he took from me:
https://github.com/luckdev000/react-client-online-booking

Also its not nice of him to also use the website public URL (in the readme) for this site that I created. I had to take them down, until this is processed.
I also had google api key I had to regenerate in case of misuse.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My entire repository was taken, copied. This is the link to my repository: [private]  
All the website public URL have been taken down for now.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This is the repository the github user took from me and added to his list repositories: https://github.com/luckdev000/react-client-online-booking

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

I think this was the license I used: GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Simply the removal of the repository on his account is enough. Thank you.

no. only the github user account: https://github.com/luckdev000
