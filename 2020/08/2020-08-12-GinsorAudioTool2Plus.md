Hello, I wrote the original code of a Audio Tool for a game called Destiny 2. Someone stole my code by decompiling the .Net code with dnspy and now made an own repo for that.  
The source code for my tool was never public, only the executable itself and i didnt want to make the code public.  
[private] stole the code and put it on a repo.  
The link to [private] repo is: https://github.com/ElbowBaggins/GinsorAudioTool2Plus

Most importantly, in [private] repo description [private] even writes that [private] copied it - without my permission - from me and even mentiones that I never wanted to provide the code.  
There has never even been a request of this person towards me, seeking for permission.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/ElbowBaggins/GinsorAudioTool2Plus  
All files in this repo

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

So far no forks found. [private] stole it by using dnspy and put my files on the repo.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It's not open source. I never wanted to open source my original code.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

If it is private and no other people can access it, I am fine with it. But my preference would be a complete removal as it was clearly stolen without my permission.  
No further legal steps have to follow if the repo just gets removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I don't have this person address.
