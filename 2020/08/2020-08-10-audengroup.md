Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work as [private] in Auden Group Limited (the Owner) whose registered address is 6th Floor, Bonded Warehouse, 18 Lower Byrom St, Manchester M3 4AP.

I have been authorised to file this DCMA notice on behalf of the Owner of the code.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work of the Owner is in a private file on github and contains coding for some of the features on the Owner's products.

The link to the copyrighted codes can be found here:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The Owner's code has been published on the public account of the infringer. The codes contained in the infringing files are the intellectual property of Auden and was posted publicly outside of company policy by a former employee.

We request that the following codes are removed as they either contain the Owner’s code or have Auden identifying codes:

[private] - this contains the Owner’s code

Specific lines :  
[private]

https://github.com/obazee7/Dee/tree/master/AudenShortTermLoanV7 - this also contains the Owner’s code

[private] - although this has been deleted from the Owner’s private repository it contains the Owner’s domain name and has information relating to our code.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The code is not open source, it is the internal code of the Owner.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The codes should be deleted as they are the internal code of the Owner and contain sensitive information.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
