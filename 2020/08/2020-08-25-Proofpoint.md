**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The original copyrighted work is part of the ETPro commercial IDS ruleset. It is located behind authentication at https://rules.emergingthreats.net. We've observed that this user not only copied content from our ruleset, and further modified our content:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I've searched but did not see, if you can find any for me to review please let me know.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The repository has rules that are commercially licensed and are not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove all ETPro signatures from their repository. We did not find them as an authorized ETPro customer so they likely stole the content from elsewhere, and thus it cannot simply be made private because they will still be in violation of our licensing.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
