**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

Hello, I am [private] for the Proofpoint Emerging Threats Ruleset which we have detected as being illegally shared on GitHUb

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/cyber00rn/SecBuzzerESM/blob/98e91cd5894e2bc1d610b2608e7335239eddf000/SecBuzzerESM/Suricata/suricata/rules/ransom.rules has the following offending content:

[private]

This is located behind authentication on the ETPro download server as this is a commercial product.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/cyber00rn/SecBuzzerESM/blob/98e91cd5894e2bc1d610b2608e7335239eddf000/SecBuzzerESM/Suricata/suricata/rules/ransom.rules

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes I did not see any others

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This is a commercially licensed product.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal, just making this private would not make them in compliance with the license theft. If they remove the ETPro signatures that would be acceptable as well (not just changing the title, but actually removing the offending lines)

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
