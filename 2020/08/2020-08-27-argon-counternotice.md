**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.  
I worked on a project with an individual and owned the codebase. This individual cut ties with me and is now claiming ownership of the codebase. I can only assume it is this individual now filing for a DMCA takedown as to further inconvenience me. I own the domain that was used in association with the project when it was private and it was registered far before this individual created their repository or registered any of their domains domains. There is also proof of repositories that I owned (previously deleted) that this user rebased in retaliation towards me. I in turn decided to stop working on the project and open source if for others to make use of.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/jaronpate/argon

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The domain associated it argon.wtf and I can prove ownership of it. There are also deployments on heroku proving that I own this codebase.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**

**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
