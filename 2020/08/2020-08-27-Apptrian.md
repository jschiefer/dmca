Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private] and I am [private] of apptrian.com. I am [private] of all Apptrian extensions that can be found here:  
www.apptrian.com  
Someone used my extensions that are NOT free and posted the code on github. I repeat these are commercial extensions they are NOT free.,

Apptrian/FacebookCatalog

Apptrian/FacebookPixel

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I did not search for the forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Apptrian/FacebookCatalog and Apptrian/FacebooPixel are under proprietary license EULA These are commercial (paid) extensions They are not free

Apptrian/ImageOptimizer and Apptrian/Minify are under OSL3.0 license and they are free.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

There is no negotiation. Paid extensions must be taken down from Github immediately. 1. There are hurting my business. 2. There are many of my customers that pay money for my extensions and It is unfair to them that some people get to use extensions without purchasing a license. For the free ones I do not care that much, but if you can take them down too.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No. I have sent you the links to their repositories you can track them yourself.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
