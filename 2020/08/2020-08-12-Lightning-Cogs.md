**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original works are code for a discord bot. These files have been re-uploaded with only minor modifications to remove attribution and falsify authorship.

These files are no longer hosted online, the ones here, in particular, were for an older version of the bot this was for which was discontinued. If necessary, the commit hashes and historical info can be provided, along with contemporaneous evidence.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There do not appear to be any forks of this repository, let alone forks that are infringing here.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The files were originally licensed under the MIT license. These files are no longer being offered under this license, nor is the repository owner in question adhering to the terms of that license had they obtained a copy per its terms.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

They must remove the infringing files.

They have intentionally removed both authorship and license, the files must be removed along with the infringing commits.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, additionally they have disabled issues on the repository, so I could not reach out to request removal.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
