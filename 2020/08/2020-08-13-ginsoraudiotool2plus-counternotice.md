The code seen here was initially reverse-engineered (actually extracted using a freely-available tool from his freely-available binaries) from another, seemingly abandoned project. The original project this was reverse-engineered from links against a GPL3 library called "WEMSharp", rendering the entire project GPL3. I have built additional features on top of this reversed codebase, mostly in the form of bugfixes.

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The project this was originally reverse-engineered from (https://www.reddit.com/r/raidsecrets/comments/eijqdw/ginsor_destiny_2_audiotool_ii/) links against the GPL3 library WEMSharp (https://github.com/Crauzer/WEMSharp/blob/master/LICENSE). As such, this project is also GPL3 and the source code MUST be released under the terms of this license. My fork removes this dependency, ironically,

Additionally, the person making the request mostly plagiarized this work from this C++ file https://zenhax.com/download/file.php?id=3795

This file is called "SourcePublic" which would seem to imply it was meant to be copied.

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
