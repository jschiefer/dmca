**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] for Certiport, a business of NCS Pearson, Inc. I have been tasked with filing takedown notices on behalf of my company.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

MrKhattak has uploaded pdf's showing our certification exam questions, answers, and practice materials. In addition, he has a txt file that directs people to a youtube video of the same exam questions etc. We have already filed a takedown notice with youtube. We do not have the material easily accesible online. MrKhattak would have to be a bad actor in one of our test centers in order to record and capture the video/images. Here is the link that shows we own/market the exam https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Certifications/Microsoft/MTA/Overview/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository is copyrighted material. https://github.com/MrKhattak/Microsoft-Exam-MTA-98-381-Introduction-To-Praogramming-Using-Python

However, the files we own or have a right to request are:  
[private]   
https://github.com/MrKhattak/Microsoft-Exam-MTA-98-381-Introduction-To-Praogramming-Using-Python/blob/master/MTA%20Syllabus.pdf  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I tried. It doens't look like there are any branches/forks that need to be removed.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. No. No. They are in violation of US and international copyright laws.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Delete the two files we've requested. To be honest, it looks like a lot of his content is stolen from other copyrighted sources. Making it private doesn't make it right.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
