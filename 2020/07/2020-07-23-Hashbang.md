Our product TypeStatus 2 (https://github.com/hbang/TypeStatus/) has been shared in deb file format for jailbroken devices on the links listed in the next section which is a breach of the license (https://github.com/hbang/TypeStatus/blob/master/LICENSE.md), which requires a copy of the license to be attached when redistributing, which the deb files do not include. This package is hosted by us on Packix (https://repo.packix.com/package/ws.hbang.typestatus2/).
