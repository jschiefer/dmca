**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the original author of the majority of the code that was hosted on this repository.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/coolstar/Chimera13

There's also a bunch of forks of the original repo that were listed in the original DMCA. These should also be restored for the most part (though I can't say to whether the 3rd party forks have additional commits)

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

The code for Chimera13 is original code that I have written in Swift that relies primarily on the public techniques that were first shown by [private] back in early 2017 in mach_portal, in combination with the remount that I have published originally in Electra for iOS 11.3.1, and the updates for it that were in Chimera. Much of these techniques pre-date uncover's existence (some of which are my own techniques in the first place), hence he has no way of claiming these for his own.

[private]'s original mach_portal code is available here: [private]  

Electra for iOS 11.3.1's remount is available here: https://github.com/coolstar/electra1131/blob/master/electra1131/post-exploit/rootfs_remount.c

Furthermore these public techniques have been shown in slides by [private] in 2018: [private] (slide 36).

And they have been shown again by [private] in 2018: https://github.com/bazad/blanket/blob/master/blanket/amfid/amfid_codesign_bypass.c

The only 3rd-party code in this repository is [private]' time_waste exploit. However, this is under an open source license (GPL) as can be seen here: https://github.com/jakeajames/time_waste/blob/0f50046ec1cafc06e7d4e5584e38ba13083757af/LICENSE. Chimera13 complies with this license by including time_waste source code in a zip file with the GPL license clearly labeled (that someone cloning the repository would have to see and extract themselves). Although Chimera13 itself is not GPL, the Chimera13 code is under the BSD-3 license [and kept free of any of the GPL code] which allows Chimera13 to keep its BSD license, but allows someone building the project to extract the time_waste exploit and relicense the entire thing as GPL to comply with the GPL license.

The material has been removed under a false DMCA claim, as the source code is definitely not from uncover, nor does uncover hold any patents against the techniques (which it can't because those techniques were published in early 2017, late 2017, early 2018, and mid 2018 by [private], [private], Me [in Electra], and [private]) respectively.

By knowingly submitting a false DMCA claim in this fashion, [private] has committed perjury and has abused the DMCA process.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
