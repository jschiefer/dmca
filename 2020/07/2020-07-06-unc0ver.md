https://github.com/coolstar/Chimera13 is based on a stolen copy of the copyrighted and closed source program unc0ver https://unc0ver.dev. He was able to obtain a leaked copy of our private unc0ver repository that was previously available at [private] for selected team members of the Unc0ver Team. Prior to the use of the stolen source code, we have been notified that an anonymous user announced the fact that they were able to obtain the private source code and had planned to distribute the source code to unauthorized users on the r/Jailbreak Discord Server. We have investigated this user and found that their first appearance on the r/Jailbreak Discord Server, where they later announced that they had obtained the source code, was approximately a day after the infringer had publicly indicated that he was able to obtain information about our work on Twitter. Soon after the use of stolen code on GitHub, his associate [private] and his cooperator [private] have uploaded and promoted the stolen copy of the source code in a public Discord server whose owners are the infringer and his cooperators/associates. We have compared the infringing repository against the stolen source code and have verified that the work was based on the source code stolen from the Unc0ver Team.
