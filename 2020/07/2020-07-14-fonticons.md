**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

My name is [private] and I am [private] of Fonticons, Inc. makers of Font Awesome Free and Font Awesome Pro. I have read and understood GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. A repo that GitHub, Inc. hosts is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my company.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

An article was copied onto your servers without permission. The original Font Awesome Pro, to which we own the exclusive copyrights, can be found at:    https://fontawesome.com/pro. This is in violation of our license at: https:// fontawesome.com/license.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The unauthorized and infringing copy can be found at: https://github.com/ngdanghau/fontawesome-pro.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not searched for forks at this moment.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This work is not open source and has a commercial license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

This letter is official notification under Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (”DMCA”), and I seek the removal of the aforementioned infringing material from your servers. I request that you immediately notify the infringer of this notice and inform them of their duty to remove the infringing material immediately and notify them to cease any further posting of the infringing material to your server in the future.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
