I had created a react.js package which is there in my repo and also published in npm. My code was first committed on Aug 17, 2019. Although it has no license specified and is public, according to https://help.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-terms-of-service#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants , it's can't be copied as it is without credit or consent.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I had created this repository, https://github.com/puncoz-official/nepali-datepicker-reactjs with the first commit on Aug 17, 2019. This package is also published on npm since then. https://www.npmjs.com/package/nepali-datepicker-reactjs

Today I stumbled upon another repository with similar name that contains exactly same source code as mine.  
https://github.com/sandy100/react-nepali-datepicker

It is clear that he copied my repository, removed all commit history, and pushed on Jan 17, 2020. It is against the spirit of OSS. It would have been okay if he forked my repository, but he copied and replace all the author information in the code.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/sandy100/react-nepali-datepicker

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I searched and found no other that violate or allegedly infringing files or repositories. There is another repository that I own [private] which is forked of https://github.com/puncoz-official/nepali-datepicker-reactjs. But https://github.com/sandy100/react-nepali-datepicker allegedly copied original repository and claim he created and maintained it.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

There are no any licensed specified other than MIT in package.json files. This repository is just publicly available.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I don't think the repository should be there as it's a clear and complete copy of the original one.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
