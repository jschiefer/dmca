**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am the copyright holder.  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am [private] of the infringed work and sole copyright owner.  
  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The ebook "Professional CMake: A Practical Guide", provided as a PDF, is only legitimately available from the Crascit website at https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
The infringing material is available in the following repository:  
  
https://github.com/anhhung1303/books  
  
The book was illegally added in the following commit (adding the book was the only change in that commit):  
  
https://github.com/anhhung1303/books/commit/d58eef36024050354cb1b3dae7b186d25d141243  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
The following forks also contain the same commit and therefore the infringing material:  
  
https://github.com/jnulzl/books  
https://github.com/MZaed/books-1  
https://github.com/PhamTDuc/books  
https://github.com/ravishersingh1/books  
https://github.com/rexchun/books-2  
https://github.com/showshop/books-1  
https://github.com/SYNTAXDZ/books  
  
There are a few other forks which are behind the original repo and do not yet contain the infringing material.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
The work is not under an open source license. It is only legitimately available through purchase from the Crascit website and sharing it publicly is prohibited. You can see the copyright terms on the second page of the material at the infringing location.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
The commit should be removed from the repository and its forks.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**  
  
**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
