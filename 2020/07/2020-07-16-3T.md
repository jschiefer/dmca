We sell a commercial software product, Studio 3T, the professional GUI for MongoDB. We offer a free 30-day trial which is available on our download page: https://studio3t.com/download/. After the 30-day trial, users can purchase a Core, Pro, and Enterprise license from our buy page: https://studio3t.com/buy/.  
  
We've set up license checks at the end of the 30-day trial to effectively control access to our copyrighted material.  
  
We've seen multiple GitHub projects that have circumvented these license checks by manually tweaking the 30-day trial timestamps and bypassing the license checks, or publishing step-by-step instructions on how to do so. This is in violation of our software's End User License Agreement.
