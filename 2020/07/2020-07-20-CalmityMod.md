**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The main owner of the mod does not want to deal with the takedown, and authorized me to act on his behalf as the co-owner of the mod.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The work that has been decompiled and posted without our consent is the source code for the Calamity Mod for the game Terraria. I have messaged the legal team of Re-Logic, the developers of Terraria, whom support modifications, in case there was any legal issues with a DMCA takedown on a modification of their code. They said they support the takedown, should we file one, if the user did not respond to any form of contact. As I have no way of contacting the user, aside from leaving an issue on their repository, I will continue with filing the takedown.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository, URL: https://github.com/jack-javana/CalmityMod-Source-code

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This one is a fork off of it, and we also wish for it to be removed. https://github.com/substisute/CalmityMod-Source-code

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Our work is currently under no license, and thus put under exclusive copyright by default. They are not allowed to modify, distribute or copy our code without our permission, and they're breaking the latter two.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We would like to have it fully removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not, I left an issue on his latest edited repository, as the Calamity one itself seemed to have this blocked/disabled. They do not seem to have any listed as of this moment.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
