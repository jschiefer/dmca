**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am a team member of HASHBANG Productions, the team that made TypeStatus Plus, and have permission from the owner to submit this DMCA.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I have noticed that https://github.com/jayguar1206/repo/blob/master/debs/ws.hbang.typestatusplus_1.4_iphoneos-arm.deb and https://github.com/jayguar1206/repo/blob/686fc2c55e78db8a6007c9e7ac4d121250a17005/Packages#L8855-L8876 is our package that is hosted on Packix (https://repo.packix.com/package/ws.hbang.typestatusplus/). The package was originally hosted on Chariz (https://repo.chariz.com) and as you can see from the packages file I linked, they have not even made any changes in terms of their own depiction pages and the information is exactly the same as what we hosted (it was a paid package at $2.99 when it was on our repo).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/jayguar1206/repo/blob/master/debs/ws.hbang.typestatusplus_1.4_iphoneos-arm.deb and https://github.com/jayguar1206/repo/blob/686fc2c55e78db8a6007c9e7ac4d121250a17005/Packages#L8855-L8876 are our content but the whole repo (https://github.com/jayguar1206/repo) is hosting pirated and content that breaches copyright from other developers. It's a piracy repo.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks to this.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is hosted on https://github.com/hbang/TypeStatus-Plus and uses Apache license. The repo that I am sending a DMCA against hosts a compiled deb file to be installed on iOS jailbroken devices and does not show the license as when it is compiled to a deb file, the license is not shown.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The only way to solve this is to remove the repo.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

https://github.com/jayguar1206 is all I have.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
