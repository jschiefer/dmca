**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

[4] I have a good faith belief that the content below is unlawful under these laws because, among other things, it reproduces and offers to distribute copies of Apple’s Beta Software without authorization;

Violation(s): Copyright Infringement  

[6] Please act expeditiously to remove the content found at the following URLs:

Please act expeditiously to remove the content found at the URLs specified.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The Beta Software is only available to members of the Apple Developer Program and can be found at https://developer.apple.com/download/;

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The infringing content must be removed immediately.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
