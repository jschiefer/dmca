The authorized version of this copyrighted website text is available on the following pages of our official organizational website:  
1) https://www.openiti.org/about  
2) https://www.openiti.org/team

The offending material is located here: https://iti-corpus.github.io/

And it draws from this repository: https://github.com/iti-corpus/iti-corpus.github.io

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repository: https://iti-corpus.github.io/  
And this github pages site: https://iti-corpus.github.io/

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove the site. It is not an authorized site for the OpenITI project. And someone has put content up on the site that we, OpenITI, have not authorized (see this link at the bottom of the webpage: "Useful online tools: Online Word Counter - count syllables")

No. We have no idea who controls this site anymore and they have not responded to repeated requests by us to take it down.
