**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The repositories in question are hosting a crack and instructions on how to successfully activate a DevExpress commercial product, and abuse our intellectual property. This is, of course, illegal.

DevExpress .NET components use the standard .NET licensing mechanism in the form of our own DXLicenseProvider implementation of the base LicenseProvider class (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.licenseprovider?view=netframework-4.8).

The repositories noted in this request (below) provide a solution to circumvent ("crack") our licensing mechanism - here is a Google translation of the description on the repository:   [private]

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repositories and their contents need to be removed, immediately.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**
