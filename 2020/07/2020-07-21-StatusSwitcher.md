**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of the package being hosted without permission.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/iAdam1n/StatusSwitcher is the package I put online (can be seen on the [private] repo - [private]) but it was illegally redistributed at https://github.com/mehmetgulcan/repo/tree/gh-pages/depictions/com.mehmetgulcan.statusswitcher. In the readme file I specifically stated "Please do not copy, modify or redistribute".

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/mehmetgulcan/repo/tree/gh-pages/depictions/com.mehmetgulcan.statusswitcher  
https://github.com/mehmetgulcan/repo/blob/gh-pages/Packages#L49-L64

The whole repo however is hosting redistributed content and some of it is piracy. However those are not my packages, only StatusSwitcher

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No it is not under a license, I specifically stated "Please do not copy, modify or redistribute".

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove StatusSwitcher from the Github repo. Ideally remove the repo because it hosts work from other people without permission but in terms of my work, just StatusSwitcher.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
