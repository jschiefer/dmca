**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am [private] of the work and the owner of the copyright.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

http://prob140.org/textbook/content/README.html

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/apachecn/prob140-textbook-zh

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No I have not searched.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The textbook is published under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license. Unauthorized translations clearly violate the “No Derivatives” restriction of this Creative Commons license, thereby infringing my copyright.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The content should be removed.

Apart from copyright violation, I have concerns about the accuracy of unauthorized translations and therefore misrepresentation of my content. But the copyright violation is my main reason for the request for removal.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
