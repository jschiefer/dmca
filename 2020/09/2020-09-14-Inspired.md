**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I searched all public GitHub repositories and listed above

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, it is not open source and is proprietary

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove the repos containing our code. They should can not remain in the public. To keep the code in a private repo they must produce evidence of purchase. It is ONLY for sale on the Odoo AppStore. We believe it is likely these are pirated copies of our software and must be deleted immediately or provide any evidence of purchase.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, sorry we do not have the contact information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
