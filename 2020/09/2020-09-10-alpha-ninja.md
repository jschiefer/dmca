**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work for a company called Alpha Ninja, subcontracted by Startech Digital LLC to develop Shopify applications and other Ecommerce solutions. We publish those apps under the name of WeDork.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We developed two Shopify apps, Trackiest ‑ Shipping Tracking and Best Sellers by Country (now called Geo AI ‑ Collections Generator).
We hired Ivan Vasilega as freelancer from Upwork as a developer. After a few months we fired him due to misconduct. Today I found out he published our code in his Github account.
The code is not published online. It was never meant to be open source and is used in a commercial product!

Here are the Shopify apps we developed:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/microgreb/trackiest  
https://github.com/microgreb/bestsellers

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I didn't find any forks  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not. It is used in a commercial product.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove all copyrighted content from Github. Block access to the user who published them.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
