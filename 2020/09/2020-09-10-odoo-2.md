**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The apps developed internally and sold through the Odoo Apps Store: https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/browse?author=Odoo%20Tools  
The apps are originally located on the private GitHub repository - [private] (the source code is auto taken to sell in the store)

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

cloud_base: https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/12.0/cloud_base/ -- https://github.com/feelwhy/tools/tree/12.0/cloud_base  
google_drive_odoo: https://apps.odoo.com/apps/modules/12.0/google_drive_odoo/ - https://github.com/feelwhy/tools/tree/12.0/google_drive_odoo

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The same modules are placed also in other repositories, but the versions are different.  
So, they are added to a separate notices

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The license for all the modules is Odoo Proprietary License v1.0  
Please find the full license in any module, e.g. [private]  
The license forbids:  
* using without a written permission / valid purchase from the Odoo store  
* distributing the app (so putting it in a public repo)

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

In case there was a valid purchase in the store - to make a repository private  
Otherwise, to fully remove all copies

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Regretfully, neither email address is published on the repo info, not 'GitHub' issues are turned on.  
We have a few of other similar repositories to whom we try to get in contact, but the cases above unfortunately do not let us do so.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
