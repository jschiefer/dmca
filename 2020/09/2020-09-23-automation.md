**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am writing to request that you can help take down my repository because it contains my credential information. As I'm the owner of this repository [private], which deleted today, but it was forked before that.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

One of my committed files to my personal repository (in public mode) has sensitive credential information, which is [username: [private]] and [password: [private]]. Here's the file: [private]  

I got reported by the security team in my company that they found my company credentials and my entire repository was being forked in [private]  

Even though I deleted my personal repository, my credentials are still be found in GPC-debug: https://github.com/GPC-debug/automation.git

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

Please take down the entire repository, URL that is being forked: https://github.com/GPC-debug/automation.git

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

For now, I only know the fork that I am reporting.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, my personal repo does not have any open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Please just take it down as soon as possible. I don't have a second-best solution.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I don't have this info.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**

My mobile phone is [private]  
Physical Address: [private]
