I am a Stanley Black & Decker employee.

* Stanley Black and Decker ("Confidential Information").

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is an internal company project for a commerce website and should not be in a public repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repository at https://github.com/epamcia/sbd

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This was brought to our attention during a routine audit from HackerOne & we believe it to be the only example.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This is not an open-source issue.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal of the entire repository as it is a Stanley Black & Decker internal project & should not exist in any repository outside of Stanley Black & Decker's control.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not have any contact details for the repository owner. None are present in the repository.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
