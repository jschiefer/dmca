Dear Sir/Madam:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am writing on behalf of the creator and owner of one or more copyrighted works appearing on your web site, which can be found on https://sp19.datastructur.es/, https://fa20.datastructur.es/, and https://sp18.datastructur.es/. Further, this material can be found in the following repositories belonging to the institution hosted on GitHub:

[private]

[private]

https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp18/tree/master/proj0

https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp19/tree/master/proj0

As a department, we own not just the skeleton files but the solutions themselves. The skeleton files, solutions, specifications, graders, and introductory material have all been authored by the department and are our sole property.

I am writing to you concerning the unauthorized reproduction, display or other use of those copyrighted works on the site. The author of this material has not granted permission or license for you to post or otherwise use those materials.

Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(c)(3)(A), please immediately and permanently remove or disable access to the following items:

https://github.com/OUWANG/CS61B/tree/master/1.2/Project%200

https://github.com/chen1649chenli/NBody

https://github.com/ShinnyHu/CS61B/tree/master/proj0

https://github.com/xiaoyang-liu-cs/berkeley-cs61b/tree/master/Projects/Project%200

All above users need to make all repositories containing any skeleton, solution, or discussion of the above content private. Removing the repositories is also a satisfactory solution for us. They may allow permissions to specific users who are not associated with the institution, but they must never allow permissions by the general public or any student currently enrolled in any UC Berkeley course.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I may be contacted by the following methods:

Physical Address: [private]

Telephone: [private]

Email: [private]

Thank you for your kind cooperation. I have also submitted a ticket on your website with the following ID: [private]. 

Regards,
