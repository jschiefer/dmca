**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I work for the Digital Forensics and Incident Response Team for Toyota Motor North America. We have identified content being shared by a former employee that I would like to request to have removed. The data is confidential and sensitive to Toyota and should not have been posted to a personal GitHub page. The compromise of this data could pose negative effects to Toyota business and development. Please take down the following pages as soon as possible:

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The copyrighted work was performed while under contract at Toyota Motor North America and is wholly owned by Toyota. The work is developmental and not posted online due to it's nature as well as the sensitivity of the project.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
I have and I found no other instances of this data.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
No, it is not under an open source license. This was work conducted while under contract at Toyota Motor North America.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
Removal is the best option for this data. Changing the status to private is not acceptable as the individual who posted it no longer has an affiliation with Toyota Motor North America and is no longer authorized to have access to this data.  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
I do not currently have their personal contact information.  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**  
  
**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**  
  
My telephone number is: [private]  
My e-mail is: [private]
