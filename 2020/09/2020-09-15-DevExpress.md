**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

DevExpress provides sources for some of its products as part of a commercial licensing scheme. The sources are provided to commercial customers in lieu of source code escrow and to serve as a reference tool for product troubleshooting. DevExpress software in question here is not open source and the sources for version 15.1 of the products are being published in the aforementioned repositories, illegally.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repositories and their contents need to be removed, immediately.

No
