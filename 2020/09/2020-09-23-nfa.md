**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have not found any forks of our software.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The software uses Codeigniter as the base framework. All code not from the framework is our copyrighted work.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

This repository needs to be fully removed as they are in violation of a NDA that was signed to destroy any copies of the code that they retained after the end of the contract.
