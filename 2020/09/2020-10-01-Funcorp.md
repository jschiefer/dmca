Dear Sir or Madam:

 

We represent the interests of Funcorp Limited (“Funcorp”), which is the owner and operator of the iFunny.co website and associated mobile application. This is Funcorp’s notice to GitHub that multiple third parties have infringed upon Funcorp’s rights under the Copyright Act through the GitHub service and that constitutes Funcorp’s formal request for removal of the below-identified links consistent with GitHub’s duties under the Digital Millenium Copyright Act.

 

Funcorp maintains techological protection measures to control access to its service, which is a copyrighted work. Funcorp’s notice concerns those Github users who offer, provide, or traffic in technology intended to circumvent Funcorp’s technological protection measure. 

 

Funcorp controls access to its copyrighted works and the copyrighted works of its users to prevent against the downloading of user posts, chats, and content, including by requiring encryption keys for access to this data through application programming interfaces, requiring usernames and passwords to access certain areas of the iFunny website and mobile content, and adopting a terms of use agreement that prevents against scraping, framing, or otherwise replicating or republishing Funcorp’s content or that of its users.

 

Several GitHub users have created tools to circumvent Funcorp’s technological protection mechanisms and to republish Funcorp’s, and its user’s, content in violation of copyright law. Specifically, the following links contain code intended to do this:

 

https://github.com/gastrodon/iFunny  
Creates a third-party interface intended to copy and interact with Funcorp’s content in violation of its terms of use agreement and copyright law;

https://github.com/gastrodon/goose  
Creates a third-party interface intended to copy and interact with Funcorp’s chat features in violation of its terms of use agreement and copyright law;

https://github.com/bakapear/ifunny-web-api  
Creates an API intended to copy and interact with Funcorp’s content in violation of its terms of use agreement and copyright law;

https://github.com/Directory/iFunny-Bearer-Token-Generator  
Creates a third-party interface intended to interact with Funcorp’s login process in violation of its terms of use agreement;

https://github.com/Directory/iFunny-Minimalistic-Chat-Bot  
Creates a third-party interface intended to copy and interact with Funcorp’s chat features in violation of its terms of use agreement and copyright law;

https://github.com/Directory/iFunny-Privacy-Geo-Obfuscator  
Creates a tool to circumvent Funcorp’s geolocation features, which are required to comply with law enforcement requests; and

https://github.com/Directory/iFunny-Basic-Auth-Token-Generator-java  
Creates a third-party interface intended to interact with Funcorp’s login process in violation of its terms of use agreement.
 

Funcorp requests that GitHub remove these links consistent with the Digital Millenium Copyright Act, which are in violation of the Copyright Act’s anti-circumvention provisions found under 17 U.S.C. § 1201. Since these tools are intended to circumvent Funcorp’s techological protection measures to prevent and control access to its copyrighted works and the copyrighted works of its users, Funcorp requests that GitHub remove these projects expeditiously.

 

I have a good faith belief that the above-identified links are offering, providing, or trafficking in technologies that circumvent Funcorp’s technological protection measures that control access to copyrighted works, and I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information contained in this notice is accurate and that I am authorized to act on behalf of Funcorp, the copyright owner.
