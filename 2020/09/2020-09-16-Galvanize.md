Hack Reactor operates an immersive Javascript coding school, where we use our proprietary curriculum to help train stellar engineers. A student who attended our program in 2018, [private] (handle:Jaguirre123) has willfully posted protected elements of our curriculum across a series of repositories on github. We've repeatedly requested in writing that he take these materials down and he has not complied.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repositoryâ€™s URL.**
