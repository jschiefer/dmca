**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is code included with the software, Unreal Engine. Information and resources for Unreal Engine can be found here:
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/valhons/EpicGames

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The repository has 0 forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Use of Unreal Engine source code is subject to the Unreal Engine End User License Agreement ("EULA"). The EULA can be found here:
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/eula/publishing

Section 1(A)(b) of the EULA limits distribution of Unreal Engine source code to other licensees who themselves have rights to the same engine code or content as distributed. Further, this section states that public distribution of Unreal Engine source code must take place either through the Marketplace or through a fork of Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network.

In the listed repository, Unreal Engine source code is distributed publicly through neither the Marketplace nor through a fork of Epic’s GitHub UnrealEngine Network. Additionally, the listed repository distributes Unreal Engine source code to non-licensees. For both reasons, the listed repository is in violation of the EULA.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository violates the Unreal Engine EULA and should be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
