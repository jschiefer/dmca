The reported post is providing an illegitimate process to bypass and access the hotstar application by false means, as to access the application the end user is required to create an account by using email id and password with a registered mobile number. Further an OTP is required to access the account for security purposes, but the reported page is providing steps to by-pass OTP and access application by unfair means.
