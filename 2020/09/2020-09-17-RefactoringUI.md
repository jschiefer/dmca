Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

The Refactoring UI package is sold on https://refactoringui.com/book by Tailwind Labs ([private] & [private] being the creators/owners).

I work at Tailwind Labs and am submitting this takedown notice on behalf of [private] and [private].

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The Refactoring UI book (https://refactoringui.com/book) is a for-profit collection of resources sold to customers. It is an essential part of Tailwind Labs' business and what powers the funding of open source projects like Tailwind CSS.

The GitHub repo I am reporting is putting all of the Refactoring UI (complete bundle) available for for everyone, for free, which of course infringes the copyright of the book.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This links to the Refactoring UI complete package: https://github.com/vdloc/bookShelf/tree/master/Refactoring_UI_-_Complete_Package_Update1

But there are potentially more copyrights infringements on this "bookshelf" repo.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, I did, but did not find any forks of this.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, these resources are closed source. Here's an example for the icons (one of the zip files in the repo): https://gist.github.com/adamwathan/cbda1bb6c23e3bf4e31f7a98b2ac0edb

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository should definitely be private, or taken down if GitHub shouldn't be used as a "dropbox" file storage service. These are videos, images, pdf documents, no code.

The entire repo is a collection of books and other resources, very much like a google drive folder.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
