The claimant holds no ownership of the code, the parts the claimant is claiming as his own are direct extensions of code that said individual had no part in creating. The claimant was provided access to the codebase with the understanding that the authors original intent was to open source the project, there were no legal bindings between either party in which that intent would ever have been altered. To add onto this, much of the code the claimant is claiming as his own isn't even the original authors and were implemented from other open-source projects (IE: https://github.com/Itokoyamato/TokoVOIP_TS3).

We have made an effort to remove code which has been discovered to have been taken from sources that were not ours and we believe were stolen from elsewhere by the claimant (IE: bs_police & bs_evidence)

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**
