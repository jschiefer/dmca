Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the creator of this code, I am not sure how it got placed on this gentlemen's account. But I do not know him and did not give him permission to re-host the code. This code actually contains some information that should not be available publicly which is primarily why it needs to be removed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

This is an older version of my project located here [private] and at one time was on a repo on my account with the same name Job_Scheduler. I gave no permission for anyone to rehost my code and since this is supposed to be a private repository and not public. If you see the history on his version of the code you can actually see comments from my previous check-ins with my user. Not sure how this situation occurred.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/santoshmenon/Job_Scheduler

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

i have not found any.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

This is not software which is licensed. it is code I have written specifically for my work and it not designed to be licensed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

please remove the repo.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

[private] is what is listed on his github page. I have already sent him an email and asked him to take it down.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**
