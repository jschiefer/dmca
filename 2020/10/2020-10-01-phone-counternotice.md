**Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the original author of every file uploaded to the repository.  
I have both the original copy with my commits and authorship, and the copy I used to re-upload after the team's conflict.  
Even though it was a team project, the original idea was taken from a third party project that already existed, and 100% of the code uploaded to my repository was written by me and only me.

After a week programming and several discussions with the owner of the repository where I was writing the code, I decided to leave and not share my authorship with the team, as they did not agree on a license and on the team ownership, and as written the entirety of it.

The person which has sent the DMCA has 0 authorship of the code, and I did not sign anything stating that I would code for [private] or [private] team.

[private] can't prove any of the files are [private] because [private] did not write any, all of the original commits belong to myself and one other programmer which has only created 2 files which are not under the subject repository discussed here.

I can prove that I written those because I have the original commits and chats.

**What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?**

Dispute the notice.

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?**

This should not be removed as I am the only author of the code.  
The idea was taken from https://github.com/N3MTV/gcphone and the code was completely written by myself from scratch.

The person who has sent this DMCA request is violating my copyrights and also has 0 authorship of the files.  
The only files (2) which have not been written by me were removed from the project with a explicit note to its original author which is not the person requesting the DMCA.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**

**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**

**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://docs.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**
