This software can be obtained under it's original website and the download link was originally based on github. it was first available under this github repo before the files uploaded on this repo get detected and then the repo disabled automatically.

HondaTuningSuite have decompiled the source of BMTune software which was highly encrypted to start his own software with theses source files. HondaTuningSuite have been created with the source codes of BMTune (Update V1.74) by the end of 2019. BMTune is not a Open source software in any way, this software contain registrations and licencing procedure with customers and its source are protected. He have used in no doubt, reverse enginering tools in order to obtain these source. Since he created a software under my source and his software have grown up quite rapidly by giving to everyone all the features and works I've made under BMTune for FREE and then create a facebook page aswell to fasten the growing process.
