**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am co-owner of the copyright with [private], and he has authorized me to act on his behalf in this matter.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
Our original copyrighted work is an Android mobile application, called "OurGroceries", in its compiled (binary) format, known as an APK (Android Package) file. This is proprietary software, distributed through the Google Play Store.  
  
The OurGroceries website is located here: www.ourgroceries.com  
The OurGroceries Android mobile application is distributed in the Google Play Store here:  
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.headcode.ourgroceries  
  
The hosted content on the GitHub website is a direct, literal copy of our proprietary APK file.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
We are aware of four locations where our APK file is posted on the GitHub website:  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Task2/blob/master/src/test/resources/groceries-app.apk  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Task2/blob/master/target/test-classes/groceries-app.apk  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Exam/blob/master/src/test/resources/groceries-app.apk  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Exam/blob/master/target/test-classes/groceries-app.apk  
  
All four of these files are identical to each other and all are literal copies of our APK file. All four should be taken down.  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
At the time of filing this notice, the GitHub web interface reported zero forks for these repositories.  
  
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
  
The APK file in question is not licensed under an open source license: it is proprietary commercial software.  
  
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**  
  
All of the above-mentioned files must be expunged from their respective repositories, leaving no copies in the git histories. For clarity, these are the URLs of the four files again:  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Task2/blob/master/src/test/resources/groceries-app.apk  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Task2/blob/master/target/test-classes/groceries-app.apk  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Exam/blob/master/src/test/resources/groceries-app.apk  
https://github.com/martinskrievs/Exam/blob/master/target/test-classes/groceries-app.apk  
  
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**  
  
We only know their GitHub username: martinskrievs  
  
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**  
  
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**  
  
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**  
  
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
