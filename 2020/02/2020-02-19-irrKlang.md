**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the developer and copyright owner of a library named irrKlang. I am also [private] of the company Ambiera, developing this library.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

irrKlang is a software licensed under a commercial license and not open source. It has been uploaded to GitHub, with its license replaced with the license text of the LGPL, here: https://github.com/Khriskh/irrklang

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files in this repository, here: https://github.com/Khriskh/irrklang

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks found

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, irrKlang uses a custom license: https://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/license.html  
The files uploaded there are all original irrKlang files, but the license has simply been replaced with the LPGL, which is illegal.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Simply remove that repository. Making it private wouldn't be sufficient.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I don't, sorry.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
