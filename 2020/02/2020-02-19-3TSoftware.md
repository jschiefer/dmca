**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work for the copyright owner, 3T Software Labs Limited.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

We sell a commercial software product, Studio 3T, the professional GUI for MongoDB. We offer a free 30-day trial which is available on our download page: https://studio3t.com/download/. After the 30-day trial, users can purchase a Core, Pro, and Enterprise license from our buy page: https://studio3t.com/buy/.

We've set up license checks at the end of the 30-day trial to effectively control access to our copyrighted material.

The two GitHub projects we've seen have circumvented these license checks by manually tweaking the 30-day trial timestamps and bypassing the license checks - and publishing step-by-step instructions on how to do so.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

1. The user, https://github.com/paynexss, has published instructions on how to hack the 30-day free trial so that users can illegally use the trial license forever: https://paynexss.github.io/2020/01/09/Studio-3T%E6%9C%80%E6%96%B0%E6%BF%80%E6%B4%BB%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-%E6%8C%81%E7%BB%AD%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0/#more

2. The user, kamronbatman, has published a different set of instructions here: https://gist.github.com/kamronbatman/1afe4033efbbf9e6e7b10c926119c575

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

As far as we can tell, the user has published this repository:  
https://github.com/paynexss/paynexss.github.io

And this particular file:  
https://github.com/paynexss/paynexss.github.io/tree/master/2020/01/09/Studio-3T%E6%9C%80%E6%96%B0%E6%BF%80%E6%B4%BB%E6%96%B9%E6%B3%95-%E6%8C%81%E7%BB%AD%E6%9B%B4%E6%96%B0

Which links to an index.html file that contains the hacking instructions and links to the relevant file(s).

The user, karonbatman, seems to have not published any repositories or forks, but has published instructions on this page:    https://gist.github.com/kamronbatman/1afe4033efbbf9e6e7b10c926119c575

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Both users are violating our software's End User License Agreement: https://files.studio3t.com/eula/eula.pdf

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We would highly appreciate if all instructions, repositories, files, and GitHub.io posts that relate to hacking/cracking our software (Studio 3T) are removed from GitHub.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
