**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have recently (December 2019) bought a SaaS company, RemoveBounce (https://removebounce.com/) from [private], and the agreement we had clearly stated that all the assets and IP would be transferred to the buyer and the seller is not authorised to use these resources again.

Unfortunately, I have recently found out that the whole platform was actually published openly on Github, including all the secret keys from the live system.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The whole codebase including the production API keys and secrets have been published on Github without anyone’s approval:    https://github.com/AcodeWizard/removebounce

I have been told by the previous owner of the company that he hired freelancers to develop some functionalities for him, but I was not aware that those freelancers made the project public without the owner's approval.

The platform is using an open-source framework, Laravel, but that does not mean that one is allowed to publish a client’s project to the world.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The whole repository should be taken down as it contains the whole platform’s code: https://github.com/AcodeWizard/removebounce

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Luckily I couldn’t find any forks of this repository.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not licensed under an open-source license. The previous owner only hired this freelancer to develop a small feature for him, but they have not made any agreement which allowed the developer to publish his work.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The only solution is to have the whole repository removed as it contains sensitive information i.e. secret API keys, instructions how to connect to database & all the security checks we make on the platform, hence a potential hacker can quickly identify a vulnerability.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Unfortunately not. I tried getting in touch with the previous owner in order to get the alleged infringer’s contact information, but he has not come back to me yet.

I am more than happy to share his details with you once he comes back to me.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**

My phone number is [private], but feel free to contact me on the email linked with this GitHub account or on the company’s email: [private]

Also, I am [private] of the company, RemoveBounce, Inc, which has its registered office in the state of Delaware is [private] and county of New Castle.

Please let me know if you would like me to provide any additional information or proof.
