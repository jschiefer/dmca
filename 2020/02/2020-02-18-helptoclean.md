I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

This particular User: "Huangxiaoxuan0621", somehow managed to copy the entire work that we have gotten our App/Web developer to do (as we are building the entire website and app from scratch) which also contains confidential information. We are not sure if this was actually leaked by the previous developer which we signed an agreement saying that all work is owned by us. Due to the repository being uploaded to GitHub by the user, someone managed to hack into our Twilio account and incurred a bill of up to nearly 2000. Also, our MailGun server was hacked. These have created many unnecessary tasks and caused tremendous stress for us.

This particular user: "Huangxiaoxuan0621", copied and uploaded the entire work that we have done. And this can be found at the following link:

https://github.com/huangxiaoxuan0621/helptoclean

Everything the user copied belongs to us and you can refer to our website/database and compare with the link whereby the information is being posted online. It is exactly the same. Our website (still under maintenance) URL: HelpToClean.com. We have also attached one screenshot of our Django database home page.

Our company name is HelpToClean and is registered in both Singapore and Malaysia with a registration number of [private] and [private]
respectively.

We would kindly appreciate if the user can remove the entire repository as it is not only leaking confidential information but also stealing what we paid to do.
