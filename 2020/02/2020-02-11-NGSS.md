Distributing illegally my work to public.
You can see NGSS all over the place in this file:

Which is identical to the version of my product (v1.8 - v1.9).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

In these directories there's my files:

And this whole folder:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The latest public version is the one I'm looking at.
