Yes, I am the content owner.

**Please describe the nature of your content ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB repository creator and owner. I determined the original license terms on it and assigned Copyright to [private] as the rest of the libsdl.org family of libraries does. The original license terms as originally found on the repository are:

Simple DirectMedia Layer

On Jan 9, 2018, as evidenced by https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/commits/master/LICENSE user [private] (who was granted collaborator access on Nov 23, 2017 to help with maintenance and essentially merge pull requests from other users contributing controller mappings to the repository) edited the copyright notice in violation of item 3 of the aforementioned license (which prevents the license terms and copyright from being modified), and in violation of the trust I placed in him to merge contributions via PRs of other users, unlawfully assigning copyright to himself. This was reverted on Feb 14, 2020 by me, after noticing the unauthorized modifications done to the licensing terms.

It is in the spirit of the open source community and agreed by all contributors to this repository that the work they submit voluntarily is to be distributed under the aforementioned original copyright and licensing terms.

Due to the above reasons, none of the files mentioned in the DMCA notice received should be taken down, and doing so would set a bad precedent for the open source community at large, since it’d be possible for contributors to steal copyright by simply editing license files and inserting their names on them.

Particular notes about each file:

check.py. Commit history at https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/commits/master/check.py. Original contributor was user [private] on Jul 5, 2016. The original license terms again those mentioned above. On Jan 20th, user [private] unlawfully inserted license terms different from those on the LICENSE file (https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/commit/ede68a4d1740881baee4804b3341d1c291bf773f#diff-80ee07c6b10902b1bae15660a736de65) assigning copyright to himself, yet again in violation of the trust placed in him by me as owner and creator of the repository. This bogus license and copyright has now been removed by me.

mapping_guide.afdesign and mapping_guide.png were voluntarily contributed to the repository to be distributed under the terms of the original LICENSE. As such the copyright is assigned to [private] and the distribution terms have not been violated.

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**
