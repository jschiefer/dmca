**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No. The changes are very recent, I am unaware of any new forks that are missing the copyright notices.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes, the SDL license (Simple DirectMedia Layer).  
The files are in violation of the license. It states :

"2. Altered source versions must be plainly marked as such, and must not be misrepresented as being the original software."
and  
"3. This notice may not be removed or altered from any source distribution."

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution would be the author reinstates the license and copyright notices he has removed.   https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/commit/9ab3461701a8e68ae2fbbe4231ab1dfa5ecbb2bd
