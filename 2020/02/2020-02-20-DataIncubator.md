Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am an employee of The Data Incubator and principle developer of the content which has been infringed. The Data Incubator operates a course on behalf of WorldQuant University (https://wqu.org/programs/data-science), including developing interactive course content, creating videos, running an online learning platform, and handling admissions (https://wqu-apply.thedataincubator.com/, private repository: https://github.com/thedataincubator/wqu-apply/). We also maintain the [private] email account and be contacted there.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
The following public repo contains IPYNB files for which The Data Incubator is the copyright holder: https://github.com/YEmreAk/DS-Notebooks. Each of the IPYNB files in fact has a footer which states The Data Incubator as the copyright holder (in fact WorldQuant University is the copyright holder, the files are mislabeled, but given our shared responsibility for maintaining the copyright, it's not relevant to the infringement). These files are developed and maintained in the following private repo: https://github.com/thedataincubator/worldquant.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**
