**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I created the asset DirectX 11 Grass Shader, which is sold under the Asset store license (no redistribution).

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It can be bought on the Unity asset store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/shaders/directx-11/directx-11-grass-shader-36335

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The linked folder includes the asset: https://github.com/Crowstrum/Noctus/tree/master/Noctus/Assets/StixGames%20-%20DirectX%2011%20Grass%20Shader

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There appear to be no forked repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Either the repository could be made private, or the folder with my asset could be removed. I tried contacting the author, but they did not replay.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I was only able to contact them trough an Issue.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**
