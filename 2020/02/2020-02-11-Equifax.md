Dear GitHub:

 

I am counsel representing Equifax Inc., the copyright owner of the works identified below. I have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

 

Certain materials (“infringing materials”) hosted by GitHub infringe Equifax’s copyrights.

 

Specifically, Equifax owns the copyrights in and to all code and other content posted at the following URLs. These copyrighted works are proprietary to Equifax and have not been made publicly available by or with the authorization of Equifax. Therefore, the unauthorized public display of Equifax’s proprietary code and other content infringes Equifax’s copyrights. These infringing materials are a literal copy of Equifax’s copyrighted works.

The infringing materials further include all code and other content in the files posted in the repositories located at the following URLs. Equifax holds the exclusive copyright in and to this code and other content and has neither published nor authorized anyone else to publish it. Therefore, the unauthorized public display of Equifax’s proprietary code and other content infringes Equifax’s copyrights. These infringing materials are a literal copy of Equifax’s copyrighted works.

In order to remedy the infringement, the affected user would need to remove all the infringing material indicated above, including all content posted at the indicated URLs and all content in the files posted within the indicated repositories.

 

We do not have contact information for the affected user, nor do we have the GitHub username associated with the affected user. Thus, we are unable to contact the affected user to request removal of the infringing material.

 

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

 

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

 

Sincerely,

/[private]/
