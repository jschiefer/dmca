A private repo for a client project has appeared online to the public hosted by the user @actiongeek. This needs to be taken down immediaitly. This is a serve breach in terms of contract, I am not sure who this user is they be either an old freelancer workin on the project or have gained unauthorised access to the work. The original project is on my account :

https://github.com/[private]

But I have just been notified of this public repo: https://github.com/actiongeek/samewavesurf

[private], this does not have rights to be visible to the public

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This entire repository must be taken down ASAP https://github.com/actiongeek/samewavesurf  
This contains sensitive information, that they do not own and is in danger of causing a large securirty risk

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There appears to be no forks, the user has either gained unauthorised access to a development machine or have breached terms from working on the project in the past and duplicated the files

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No this a private client project which the user if worked on was under contract this is not for public sharing

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal of the project would be the safest solution, it is a security risk for user data of the platform SameWaveSurfTrips

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No, I do not know the user @actiongeek or have had any correspondence with them before, I was notifeid by GitGuardian (gitguardian.com) about a API key being public
