Dear Github Developer Support,

Thank you for following up and for the additional guidance regarding your response on December 31, 2019. As mentioned in our previous notices (October 24, 2019, November 8, 2019, and January 8, 2020), TeaTV is an app notoriously devoted to copyright infringement (https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/20/netflix-and-hbo-shows-are-getting-pirated-on-teatv-and-other-sites.html).

We previously provided you links to the Github repositories that TeaTV is using and are now providing you with the attached file titled “GitHub-Code” which shows code hosted on Github that provides links to pirate sites with infringing copies of motion pictures and television shows that are scraped by the TeaTV app to provide access to the infringing content users are looking for. For your convenience, we have included links to the “JSON” files previously provided:

https://github.com/TeaTV/TeaTV-macOS/blob/master/misc/movie_providers.json

https://github.com/TeaTV/TeaTV-macOS/blob/master/misc/todo_host.json

https://github.com/TeaTV/TeaTV-macOS/blob/master/misc/todo_providers.json

https://github.com/TeaTV/TeaTV-macOS/blob/master/misc/tv_providers.json

Also attached is a file titled “GitHub-Executables” which shows that the final version of the app is available for download from the GitHub platform. These executable files are pre-configured to infringe copyright-protected motion pictures and television shows that are owned or controlled by our Members. For your convenience, we are also including links to the “EXECUTABLE” files:

https://github.com/TeaTV/TeaTV-Windows/releases

https://github.com/TeaTV/TeaTV-macOS/releases

https://github.com/TeaTV/TeaTV-Android/releases

We also analyzed network traffic generated by the TeaTV app and observed connections to https://api.teatv.net/api/get_config. In the API output, our team observed that it is connecting to GitHub using related accounts. Following are 3 GitHub links used by the API:

https://github.com/flyhighinthesky-colab/notion/releases/download/9.9.9r/TeaTV_v9.9.9r.apk

https://github.com/flyhighinthesky-colab/notion/releases/download/9.9.7/TeaTV_v9.9.7r.apk

https://github.com/vividclown/vivandi/releases/download/2.7b/TPlayer_v2.7b.apk

Attached as Exhibit A is a list of some of the motion pictures that are owned or controlled by our Members and that are being infringed by the TeaTV app.  Exhibit A is provided as a representative sample of the infringements occurring as a result of the operation of this app.  Exhibit A is not intended to suggest that infringement of our Members’ content by the TeaTV app solely involves the listed films.

We request that you remove or disable access to the GitHub repositories used by TeaTV in their entirety, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(c)(3)(A)(ii) (DMCA “representative list” provision), 17 U.S.C. § 512(i)(1)(A) (DMCA “repeat infringer” provision), and/or GitHub’s Terms of Service, which prohibit use of your facilities for copyright infringement (https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service). See Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios, Inc. v. Grokster Ltd., 545 U.S. 913, 940 n.13 (2005) (“the distribution of a product can itself give rise to liability where evidence shows that the distributor intended and encouraged the product to be used to infringe”).

We are providing this notice based on our good faith belief that the use of motion pictures and television programs owned by the MPA Member Studios in the manner occurring via the Project is not authorized by the copyright owners, their agents, or the law.  The information in this notification is accurate and, under penalty of perjury, we are authorized to act on behalf of the MPA Member Studios, which own or control exclusive rights under copyright that are being infringed in the manner described herein. This letter is without prejudice to the rights and remedies of the MPA Member Studios and their affiliates, all of which are expressly reserved.
