**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. And hereby I state the following:

On my private repository ([private]) I had a collaborator https://github.com/laurentiufotache
When I remove him from the repo, on the next day, a repository appeared https://github.com/laurentiufotache/Cookingsaver with the same contents as mine

On top, it contains API keys and such sensitive information that links the application to Google services.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repo is a android application published in beta https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.coopabnd.cegatim.lite

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The whole repo https://github.com/laurentiufotache/Cookingsaver

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I think it is not the case, as the fork was removed automatically by you.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. Is a private repo, with a private Android application, listed in Play Store since 23 March 2019

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Remove and delete the repository.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
