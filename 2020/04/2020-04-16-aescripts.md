**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

They must be removed, they are not allowed to be hosted by anyone besides us so private repo's would NOT be ok.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No
