The main repo: https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended

Infringed files:
https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended/blob/master/server/classes/player.lua
The entire file is a blatant copy and edit of the original work (#1)

https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended/blob/master/server/functions.lua#L23 (from that line
The "registering of commands" has been fully copied (from #2) and massively edited to fit their needs

https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended/blob/990feb9ca96cab7a14865bdfc084f0f557235d4c/server/main.lua#L279
The "updateCoords" is just a rename of "setCoords" (see #3) with the exact same functionality, just more poorly written

https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended/blob/990feb9ca96cab7a14865bdfc084f0f557235d4c/server/main.lua#L256
This is mainly just a refactor from the original in #4, while it seems heavily edited if you look at for example (https://github.com/ESX-Org/es_extended/blob/990feb9ca96cab7a14865bdfc084f0f557235d4c/server/main.lua#L238) you can clearly see that it's a straight copy from (https://github.com/kanersps/essentialmode/blob/4b0641198c12cac0f424221450f4929ed8f73d91/server/player/login.lua#L15) while just being edited a bit to suit their needs

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I do not see the need to take down any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It's licensed under AGPLv3, according to the license any modifications made no matter how tiny need to be licensed under the same.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I require full credit for what I have made. Otherwise removal is requested.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not
