**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work in Legal & Compliance for 9302_6870 QC INC to which belongs the WeJustSocial.com service and all it's developed source code. WeJustSocial is a software development company which has created the WeJustSocial platform, Cerberus API, WJS-API, WJS-Frontend-Build and wjs-chrome-ext. I am authorized by the company President to submit this DMCA takedown request.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The repository https://github.com/bjwork20/Instagram_justsocial publically includes Cerberus API, WJS-API, WJS-Frontend-Build and wjs-chrome-ext which is a duplicate of our PRIVATE REPOSITORY available at [private]. You will also be able to validate that our Push date are prior to those in the bjwork20 repo.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The whole repository https://github.com/bjwork20/Instagram_justsocial

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have not found forks of this repo. I believe this is the only one we need to take down at this time.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

There is no other solution than deleting our copyright material which is a private repo that was publicly posted on their github repo. The code shouldn't be owned by this unknown individual. Making it private is not an option (but would still be preferable than having it public).

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not, I am unable to identify "bjwork20".

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
