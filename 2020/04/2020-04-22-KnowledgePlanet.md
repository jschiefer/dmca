I have read and understand Github's Guide to Filing A DMCA Notice.

i was created a Repository called Security_Codes last year，my Github Url is :[private],It contains my personal code and some information, the some datas which belongs to the privacy and confidentiality document, and comes from the Chinese community named Knowledge Planet. But these data files belong to the privacy files paid by users. Due to my carelessness, these files were uploaded to GitHub. Although I deleted the repository at that time, the user https://github.com/SteelBIM fork has the repository and it still exists

The following is Github's Url and Screenshots about our forked Repository:
