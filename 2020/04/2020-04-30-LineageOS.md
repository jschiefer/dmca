**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am authorized to submit this request because some commits are stolen from me personally and some damage the copyright of the LineageOS non profit organization which I am contributing to (I see my contributions to LineageOS also considered under this copyright notice).

Example contributions from me:

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The GitHub user [private] already has a series of taken down repositories (see [private] or [private]).

Here is one example commit which he took from me, squashed some other code in it and reset the author.    
https://github.com/CesiumOS-Devices/device_samsung_a5xelte/commit/55bcb5b61f8b0c23876a000e066f3864547dd6be  
https://github.com/dariotrombello/android_device_samsung_j7elte/commit/b84de58fa398d8d09365d09594b1da48c00227b1  

[private] also changed the copyright name from LineageOS to CesiumOS which is definitely not allowed. I can not message him over telegram anymore as I am blocked and I also do not see any point in it because something other than him insulting me I could not expect. I also opened an issue on his GitHub page to make him aware but he just removed my words, closed it and blocked me from the organization. More evidence below:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/CesiumOS-Devices/device_samsung_a5xelte  
https://github.com/CesiumOS-Devices/device_samsung_a7xelte  
https://github.com/CesiumOS-Devices/device_samsung_a3xelte  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

There are no forks of these repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Yes, it is licensed under Apache 2.0. His commits violate against the duty to keep the copyrights and authorships as they are.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

To keep the license headers as they were and keep attribution of commits. Otherwise shutting down these repositories is the only solution I see. Contacting him apparently does not get me anywhere.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
