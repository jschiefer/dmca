APPLE INC.’S DMCA TAKE DOWN NOTICE (CD033795)

Dear DMCA Agent:

We are outside intellectual property counsel for Apple Inc. (“Apple” or “Copyright Owner”), the owner of certain copyright protected software identified below, which has been posted to GitHub.org without license. Please direct all future correspondence related to this matter to me.

We hereby provide notice of copyright infringement pursuant to the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “Act”). 

Copyright Owner is the owner of copyrights in a variety of unpublished internal computer programs (the “Works”), which Copyright Owner identified available for distribution via your services.  Apple does not distribute its unpublished internal works and considers these works to be confidential to Apple, in addition to subject to copyrights owned by Apple.  These programs have not been publicly released, and are specifically designed to make use of internal Apple resources and in many cases employ internal Apple access credentials. It has come to Copyright Owner’s attention that uses of your service have made these Works available at these repositories:
