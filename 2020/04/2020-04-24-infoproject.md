**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**   
   
Yes, I am the copyright holder.   
   
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**   
   
I am contacting you from Infoproject LLC - https://infoproject.biz/en   
   
We are a software company (founded 1989) based in Republic of North Macedonia. We have developed a website for a customer using Wordpress CMS and hosted it on our own server. The site in question is https://flf.ukim.edu.mk (currently inactive as per request of the client not to enable it).   
   
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**   
   
The repository in question contains an html dump of the Wordpress website we have developed for the customer. The reason we have noticed this infringement is because we have received an email from Google warning us that our API key has suddenly appeared on a public repository. This has been done without our consent. We are in no way connected to the repository creator: simonagel (https://github.com/simonagel) and we didn't authorize him/her to perform this action. Therefore we would like to have the entire repository taken down as it contains files that have been unlawfully procured from us and without our approval.   
   
We have letters of communication with the customer, the warning email from Google API Developer Console as well as the entirety of the website including the database (which fortunately has not appeared anywhere by the time of writing this email).   
   
Whatever documents you may require as to prove the ownership of the content, we can and will be able to provide. We can also provide a full screen capture of the site in it's fully functional form, as it currently resides on our own servers although the domain doesn't resolve (as per request of the customer not to have it enabled).   
   
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**   
   
https://github.com/simonagel/flf_repo   
   
The entire repository as it contains the html content of the site.   
   
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**   
   
No, Git repository shows it currently has 0 forks. Is there any other way we should be searching for this?   
   
**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**   
   
The website in question has been developed using the Wordpress CMS which is itself open source. The content of the site, however, has been developed by us and is not open source. The API key from Google is absolutely not for unauthorized use.   
   
**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**   
   
The immediate solution would be the complete removal of all files that that are our property. The repository may not be made private, nor we authorize any further use. As for additional steps, we will consult with our legal team.   
   
**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**   
   
No, we do not currently have the infringer's contact information.   
   
**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**   
   
**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**   
   
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**   
   
**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
