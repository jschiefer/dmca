**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the owner of the PHP framework "Leverod", and of the e-commerce plugin "Custom Registration Fields". I am the owner of the website leverod.com.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

My website is www.leverod.com and this is the list of softwares that I sell:
https://www.leverod.com/opencart/demos.php

List of licenses of the softwares uploaded illegally on GitHub:
https://www.leverod.com/custom-registration-fields/License.html
https://www.leverod.com/License.html

At the bottom of every license file, there is my email address, which is the same email of my github account, as evidence that I am the owner of such softwares.

I have contacted by email the person who uploaded the files but I didn't receive any answer.
It's almost two years that my software is being exposed to free downloads on that repository and it's exactly two years that I am unable to sell that software anymore but now I understand why, people are just downloading the files for free from GitHub.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The folder containing the copyrighted software is this:
