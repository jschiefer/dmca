The software in question which we believe was infringed covers two WHMCS modules from our collection:

1) Proxmox Cloud For WHMCS (https://www.modulesgarden.com/products/whmcs/proxmox-cloud) – a provisioning modules designed for the WHMCS platform, enabling its owners and their customers to create and manage multiple Proxmox virtual servers at virtual data centers straight within their WHMCS system.

2) OpenStack VPS For WHMCS (https://www.modulesgarden.com/products/whmcs/openstack-vps) – another provisioning module designed specifically for WHMCS which makes it possible to provision and supervise OpenStack virtual servers in this exact system.
