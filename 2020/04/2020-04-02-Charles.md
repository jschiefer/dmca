**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I work in Sales & Support for XK72 LTD. XK72 LTD is a software development company which has created and sells Charles Web Debugging Proxy Application.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

http://www.charlesproxy.com

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

A crack for license keys for Charles Proxy https://github.com/8enet, https://github.com/8enet/Charles-Crack

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No. I am unsure how to do this.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

I am unfortunately unable to communicate in Chinese so can't write directly to the user to request they remove the license key crack. XK72 LTD would like them to remove the license key crack.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
