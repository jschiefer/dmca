Hello,

User mattconsto uploaded all my site's (https://fantasynamegenerators.com) script content to share it freely with the world as a new app he seems to have created. I've reported him in the past (August of 2018), it was removed shortly after, but it seems he put it back up. The code in question is:  
https://github.com/rivy/js.fantasy-names

He credits my site at the bottom, but nothing on my site says he'd be free to do so. It clearly states at the bottom:  
"You're free to use names on this site to name anything in any of your own works, assuming they aren't already trademarked by others of course.

All background images part of the generators are part of the public domain and thus free to be used by anybody, with the exception of user submitted backgrounds, images part of existing, copyrighted works, and the pet name generator images.  
All other original content is part of FantasyNameGenerators.com and cannot be copied, sold or redistributed without permission.

Copyright© 2012-2020 FantasyNameGenerators.com."

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Virtually all scripts from the name generators on my site, with the exception of updates he hasn't added to his version yet.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/rivy/js.fantasy-names

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No open license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Removal didn't seem to work last time, but it was at least effective for some time.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
