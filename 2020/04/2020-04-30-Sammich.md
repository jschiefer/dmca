Hello, I [private] am the original developer of this software, I just had you take down another page:

All of it. The link I want taken down is: https://github.com/buracc/sammich-ahk

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All of them.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

All of it taken down please.
