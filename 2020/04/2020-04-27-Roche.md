Hi support,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

**Identify the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed**  
https://github.com/aplater/ESSchedule/blob/master/Equipment%20Reservation%20Tool/Equipment%20Reservation%20Tool.xlsx - proprietary

**Identify the material that you allege is infringing the copyrighted work listed in item #2, above.**  
The whole repo was forked from an employee who has removed the public repository that contains genentech google script, userid and research information  
There was no new commit by the user

**Explain what the affected user would need to do in order to remedy the infringement.**  
Remove the repo

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
