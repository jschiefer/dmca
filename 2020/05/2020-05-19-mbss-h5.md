Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I ([private] at github) made a mistake to publish repositories (mbss-h5, and already deleted, no url now) public in public way,  
The repos below directly or indirectly forked from my mbss-h5 repo,  
https://github.com/hwedwin/mbss-h5 Author: [private] <[private]>  
https://github.com/ps51/mbss-h5

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

mbss-h5 at github is my repo, it's developed for my customer, I originally publish it on github to allow team member to co-work, but some github users (hwedwin and ps51) forked it. But the very original repo mbss-h5 have been removed long ago, I have no its url, github can verify by check internal data.

https://github.com/hwedwin/mbss-h5 Author: [private] <[private]>  
https://github.com/ps51/mbss-h5  
the two repos is all forked directly or indirectly from my deleted mbss-h5

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The two repos should be deleted or forbit public access from github.  
https://github.com/hwedwin/mbss-h5  
https://github.com/ps51/mbss-h5

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

The two remain forks of my mbss-h5 are the last two forks, other forks did been removed then I contact the holders and ask them to remove it.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

no license declaration. I just publish mbss-h5 for collaboration, but someone irrelated forked it. I do not know it when I delete my mbss-h5 repo, until recently my custom ask me to delete all the forks.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

the to be deleted repos have no activities, their owner just fork it for reference, delete them will have no impact for them, just inform them to delete their repos.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
