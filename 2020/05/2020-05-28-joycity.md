**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an employee of JOYCITY, I am submitting this DMCA takedown on behalf of JOYCITY, a company in South Korea servicing Freestyle, Freestyle 2 and 3on3 Freestyle.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The folder contains our source codes of a game called Freestyle. You can check our game on our websites.

Our Company URL: https://www.joycity.com/  
Freestyle Korea: https://fs.joycity.com/web/main.do  
Freestyle China: https://www.fsjoy.com/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

All files in the URL: https://github.com/RaoMiao/freestyle

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I am not sure if this is the right way to check the forks, but I have checked this URL: https://github.com/RaoMiao/freestyle/network/members
and saw that it was written 'No one has forked the repo yet', but I am not sure.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, not an open-source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

We would like the folder and the files at https://github.com/RaoMiao/freestyle to be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not have the contact information of the infringer, nor do not know who it is.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
