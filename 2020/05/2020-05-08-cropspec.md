I would like a forked copy of our Crop-Spec repository taken down. This is proprietary code created and owned by me.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original code, which is an agriculture application that calculates crop-inputs for fertilizer applications to crops, was developed by my company over the past few years and resides here: [private]

The following repository should be taken down:

No. The repository must be removed immediately.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not. I do not know the individual who posted this content. However, I do recognize the fork. It was shared with a contract developer by the name of [private] who I have contacted as well.
