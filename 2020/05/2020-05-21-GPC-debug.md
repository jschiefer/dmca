Hello dear Github

I am [private], a Chinese developer. It is nice to be able to use GitHub such a professional and efficient platform, and now I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution

I have read and understand Github's Guide to filling a DMCA notice

The Github user GPC-debug (https://github.com/GPC-debug) fork my public repo(https://github.com/hon-key/goodbuiness) which now is a private repo and will be remove soon. Since The repo contains the company's important source code, algorithm and system configuration infomation belonging to the companys internal data asset, we hope this fork can be remove from Github. And worse, I coundn't contact him. So I hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove https://github.com/GPC-debug/goodbuiness and thank you very much

The following is my contact infomation:  
email: [private]  
phone: [private]

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web page is notauthorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the infomation in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Hoping for your response, and thanks again.
