Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I'm the developer of a platform fighting game engine known internally as "Super Smash Flash 2 Engine", a proprietary, closed-source game engine associated with my company McLeodGaming Inc. I am also the leader behind Super Smash Flash 2, a fan game built using this engine. Both code from the engine and game itself were de-compiled and uploaded to GitHub without my permission, and neither are licensed for distribution by third-parties.

Also note that I do keep the core source code on a private Github repository that has never been made public at any point, which can serve as proof of ownership and the fact that the code from the game was de-compiled:

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is the source code for my proprietary, closed-source engine known as "Super Smash Flash 2 Engine", which was uploaded to the listed repositories without permission. Note that this engine is different from the Super Smash Flash 2 game itself, which is a Super Smash Bros. fan game built using the engine. The engine itself does not contain any multimedia content or playable game, rather it is purely a platform fighting game engine in its raw form designed to ship platform fighters with for Flash and Adobe AIR.

An example official project built utilizing this engine may be found here:

The offending repositories has de-compiled the source code of this game in order to upload both an unauthorized modified version of the game itself and engine to GitHub.
