Dear GitHub,

I would like to kindly request that you take down the following code repositories:

https://github.com/millanbatra/UCLA-CS144-Web-Applications  
https://github.com/weimouhe/cs144  
https://github.com/YufeiHu/CS144-Web-Applications

https://github.com/Brick-Mover/CS144-Project5-Web-Benchmark-and-Spark  

The above repository contains code, articles, data, and class notes that are part of a course that is being taught at the University of California, Los Angeles, and are provided to students with a license agreement that allows only private/individual copies. I explicitly disallow placing the original materials or any works derived from them somewhere publicly accessible. The students all signed and submitted an agreement form acknowledging this policy. As such, the posting of these materials on your site is a copyright violation and a UCLA academic honesty policy violation. Practically, all files in the repositories are verbatim copies of my original work or its derivatives. As concrete data points, I provide example files from each repository that are verbatim copies of my files or their derivatives.
