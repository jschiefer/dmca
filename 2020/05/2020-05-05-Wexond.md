**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/wexond/desktop  
Desktop web browser based on Electron which is under GPL v3 license.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/dothq/browser

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No forks have been discovered

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Wexond uses GPL v3 license.

The fork of Wexond does not contain valid copyright notice in their resulting binaries of version 2.1.0.  
[private]

There has been no update since last year (potentially exposing users to security vulnerabilities and possibly damaging Wexond reputation) thus the developer does not fulfill the following obligation:  
"The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date."

The developer is also willing to release closed beta binaries to people who sign a form here: [private]

Despite attempts contacting with them, they blocked me on social media and did not respond to my requests.

I have definitely taken [fair use](https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22) into consideration and in my opinion a developer doesn't play fair when they fork my project, change it minimally, advertise it under a different name and logo and then insult me in their public Discord server with 100+ members.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

This repository could be either removed or made private on GPL v3 conditions.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
