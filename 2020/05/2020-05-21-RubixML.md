I am [private] of Rubix ML and own 100% of the copyright to the code in question.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Rubix ML is an open-source machine library for the PHP language under the MIT license. The work that was infringed is my implementation of the CART/Regression Tree algorithm. Blocks of code, including entire files in some cases, were copied from my work to the infringing party's repository without attribution or authorization otherwise. The links to the infringed files and the commits they were copied from are listed below.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No and I do not wish to pursue DMCA claims with those forks at this time.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Both works are licensed under the MIT license. The files listed are infringing because they violate the terms of the MIT license. More specifically, the infringing work does not provide the copyright notice (author attribution) and license of the original work. Quoting directly from the MIT license "The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software."

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The author of the infringing work can attribute the original author in the files that were copied and include the original author's copyright notice in their repository per the MIT license.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
