Hi Github,

 

I am an employee of Unicorecomm corporation, and please help me !!!

 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.


I upload the classified source code of my company because of my fool.  
Some one fork my repository, and many people forked it or clone it.

Now I already delete my repository and GitHub account, but some fork repositories still exist.

 

The following are the fork repositories URLs which are direct literal copy of my work! Completely forked my entire repository.

https://github.com/123tt456/sensorAidingForPDR

 

Since the repositores contains the company’s important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company’s internal data assets, I hope GitHub as soon as possible to help us completely remove all.

 

My contact information:
