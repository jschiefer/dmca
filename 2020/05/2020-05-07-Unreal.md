**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am an agent of Epic Games, Inc.

Epic Games, Inc. retains copyrights in their code, including Unreal Engine and related software.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work is code intended for use with the software, Unreal Engine. Information and resources for Unreal Engine can be found here:  
https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The repository: https://github.com/guedin/UE4Celshade

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

https://github.com/aaronfang/UE4Celshade

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Unreal Engine code is governed by the terms of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement, which can be found at https://www.unrealengine.com/eula.

The terms of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement state that public distribution of Unreal Engine mods or source code must take place through either the Marketplace or through a fork of Epic's UnrealEngine Network.

The identified repository distributes Unreal Engine source code not through the Marketplace or through a fork of Epic's UnrealEngine Network. This violates the terms of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository contains Unreal Engine code distributed in violation of the Unreal® Engine End User License Agreement, and so the entire repository should be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
