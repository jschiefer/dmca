**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the copyright owner because I released the code, but it was transferred to the personal warehouse by other users.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I uploaded this code to my warehouse.  
But I didn't notice that it was made public to the code.  
Then I found out that someone had copied my code.  
So I quickly deleted my warehouse.  
But at the same time, I also want the users who copy my warehouse to delete the code or make it private.

Warehouse address : https://github.com/shigongchen/wherehows-1

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The whole warehouse.  
https://github.com/shigongchen/wherehows-1

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

This is the only branch.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

Did not obtain an open source license

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The best solution is to delete the warehouse or make it private.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I can't find his contact information. The address of the warehouse is https://github.com/shigongchen/wherehows-1.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
