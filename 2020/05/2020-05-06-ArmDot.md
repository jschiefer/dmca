I am an the [private] of the program called ArmDot. It's commercial software, not open source.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, I don't know how to do that. I got a message from a person on Skype that he is going to publish sources.

All the files should be removed.
