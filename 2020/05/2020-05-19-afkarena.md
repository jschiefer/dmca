Our copyright regarding to one mobile game named ‘AFK Arena’ has been registered in China on June 11, 2018. The registered number is 2018SR437544. This game is operated by lilithgames which is a well-known mobile game enterprise. The URL of game official website is as follows:
https://www.afkarena.com/

We find a Github user named Mila432 decoded our game apk， and use protoc.exe parsing our proto files to python files which are identical to our original copy work. He also do some hacker job based on the codes. He put these original codes and his hack codes on his repository. The user’s behavior is not authorized. There are some evidences as follows:

1.The tittle of his repository is ’ AFK-Arena-Bot’ with description ‘A bot for AFK Arena written in Python’. This tittle and its content obviously refers to the game ‘AFK Arena’.

2.We can see one of the files published on his repository named ‘lilithgame.py’. This refers to the name of the operator of the game.

3.There are three files regarding to our critical protocol information. Their names are ‘common_pb2.py’, ‘down_pb2.py’, ‘up_pb2.py’. These files defined how clients communicate with server. For example, we can find ‘lilith’ and ‘hgame’ many times in ‘common_pb2.py’. The ‘lilith’ refers to the name of the operator of the game and the ‘hgame’ refers to internal mark of the developer group in lilithgames. The URL of ‘common_pb2.py’ is as follows:
https://github.com/Mila432/AFK-Arena-Bot/blob/master/common_pb2.py

4. The user attempted to grab IP of our game server. The codes in ‘main.py’ shows:
self.ws = create_connection("ws://hgame-tva-slb-gs.lilithgame.com:10000",header={'Upgrade':'websocket','Connection':'Upgrade','Sec-WebSocket-Key':self.getRND(),'Sec-WebSocket-Protocol':'game_10001','Sec-WebSocket-Version':'13'})

This action can be seen as hack attack. The URL of ‘main.py’ is as follows:
https://github.com/Mila432/AFK-Arena-Bot/blob/master/main.py

5. The user attempted to create large number of accounts. The codes in ‘lilithgame.py’ shows:
if __name__ == "__main__"
a=lilithgame()
print a.makeaccount()

This action can be seen as hack attack. The URL of ‘main.py’ is as follows:
https://github.com/Mila432/AFK-Arena-Bot/blob/master/lilithgame.py
