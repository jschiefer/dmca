Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.

I am a [private] for Cvent, Inc., which acquired DoubleDutch, Inc. in June 2019. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.

The copyrighted works were created by a former employee, [private], of DoubleDutch during his employment and were utilized for DoubleDutch's mobile application. The employment agreement explicitly stated that any inventions created during the course of employment will be assigned to DoubleDutch.

[private] has posted 9 unique repositories on his Github profile that he created during his employment with DoubleDutch. The utilization of the code in DoubleDutch's app is proprietary and as such is not publicly available.

What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.

Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.

Yes.

Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?

No, the infringing files are not licensed under an open source license.

What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?

The best solution would be removing the repositories since [private] is falsely alleging they are his own intellectual property.

Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.

I have not been able to locate current contact information for [private].

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.
