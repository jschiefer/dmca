**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

WeIare currently working through all the forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The work is NOT licensed as open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Considering the volume of copyright violation of my work, I ask that GitHub remove all my work from the offending repos.

Furthermore, since all of these repos hosting our works also contain copyright violations of dozens, if not hundreds of authors, I ask that GitHub remove these repos. They are breaking copyright law and hurting creators around the world.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Considering the volume of copyright violation of our work, I ask that I do not have to look up the contact information for hundreds of people using GitHub to pirate my work.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
