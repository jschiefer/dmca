**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] of the program called ArmDot. It's a commercial software, not open source.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It's a program to manipulate .net assemblies. All source code of the ArmDot was written myself from scratch. ArmDot is a closed source software. Decompilation is prohibited. Here the website: armdot.com, here the license: https://www.armdot.com/docs/armdot/license.html

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/AustralianDeveloper/ArmDotModSource

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

No, I don't know how to do that. I got a message from a person on Skype that he is going to publish ArmDot sources that were retrieved using the decompilation technique.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

ArmDot is not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

All the files should be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
