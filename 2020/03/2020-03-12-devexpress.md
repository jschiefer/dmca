**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

I am the [private] at Developer Express Inc ("DevExpress"). DevExpress owns the intellectual property, trademark, and copyrights on all of its software development products.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

DevExpress is a software developer tools vendor - our products are available commercially at https://www.devexpress.com/.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

https://github.com/youxia2016/DevExpressCrack

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I am not aware of any forks, at this time.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The repository in question is hosting a crack and instructions on how to successfully activate a DevExpress commercial product. This is, of course, illegal.

DevExpress .NET components use the standard .NET licensing mechanism in the form of our own DXLicenseProvider implementation of the base LicenseProvider class (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.componentmodel.licenseprovider?view=netframework-4.8).

The repository noted in this request (below) provides a solution to circumvent ("crack") our licensing mechanism - here is a Google translation of the description on the repository: https://go.devexpress.com/GitHubTranslation.aspx

The DevExpressTools.dll assembly replaces the GetSavedLicenseKey method that takes license information (stored during the legitimate installation of DevExpress components) with a custom methods that thus breaks the protection.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository and its contents need to be removed, immediately.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

No.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
