Hello,

we're the copyright owner of the 'Digital Delivery' code that's now public including our credentials.

This app is used to let users send ecard and share music with radio and tv and we own it since 2003 with different versions uploaded on Github.

This developer worked with us for some weeks and then stoled this and other codes publishing them on many sites.

His username is [private] or [private] or many other fake used in.

I really hope you can remove the profile soon.

Many thanks

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

i don't know

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, we only used Sendgrid API there and they've contacted us when found the username and password shared

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

They only have to remove teh full code as we are the only copyright owner.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I tried to contact him/her but all the accounts have been removed, including skype.

As I said, they are fake accounts and just stole money via Freelancer and many other sites.
