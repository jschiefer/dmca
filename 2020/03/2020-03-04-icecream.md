I created a theme on vs code called "Chocolate Ice Cream" https://github.com/hamadmarri/chocolate-ice-cream-theme

I posted in https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/et073a/chocolate_ice_cream_dark_theme_for_vs_code/

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

https://github.com/officialpiyush/sublime-chocolate-ice-cream-theme

the user "@officialpiyush" asked me to publish a sublime version for the theme. I agreed but I told him he must put a link to my theme in his readme file. See here the discussion https://www.reddit.com/r/vscode/comments/et073a/chocolate_ice_cream_dark_theme_for_vs_code/ffh24an/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x

also in direct I told him before I confirm that must link my repository in his readme file. He was saying his busy and it is been a month since then. I believe he is not going to link my github and not willing to give me a credit either. I do not like the disrespect from this user, it is easy to put my link in readme file it is less than 1 minute. Also, anyone copies others works or arts must at least mention them or link to their page for credit. I feel that I got fooled by this user and I request for taking down his repository. I have screen shots of the direct communications when I asked him to link my repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

"Chocolate Icecream.tmTheme"

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

there are no forks

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

no license, but I read in github that if I created repository in github I have the copyright from github

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

no, because even if the user put my link in his readme after this "DMCA takedown" request, the user might remove my link or credit later. I do not trust this user

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**
