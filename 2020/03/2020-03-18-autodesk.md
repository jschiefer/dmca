I am [private] of Autodesk, Inc. and the infringing content posted to Github.com is the copyrighted material of Autodesk, Inc.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The original copyrighted work consists of the confidential and proprietary source code of Autodesk, Inc. products. This material has not been posted online by Autodesk, Inc.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The following links need to be removed:  
https://github.com/KennanChan/Revit.Headless  
https://github.com/salaros/Revit.Headless  
https://github.com/htlcnn/Revit.Headless  

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
The original link is:  
https://github.com/KennanChan/Revit.Headless

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

This work is not under an open source license. This work is licensed under a proprietary license that includes specific prohibitions against reverse engineering and bypassing of license manager limitations. The materials included at these links additionally provide instructions for how to reverse engineer & bypass technical licensing measures in violation of Autodesk's end user license agreement terms. The purpose of this post is to enable persons who have not properly licensed Autodesk software to access and use the core engine of one of Autodesk's most important proprietary software products.  

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

This material has been posted by someone who appears to be an employee of a Chinese competitor of Autodesk, Inc. and the only solution is complete removal of the indicated links. The fact that it is being forked indicates that this highly confidential and proprietary information of Autodesk, Inc. is at great risk of spreading and causing Autodesk irreparable harm.
