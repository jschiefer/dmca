If you need access for privacy reasons I am willing to grant that, just need a username to add.
The products are for sale, listed on the site under the sales account "ModFreakz":

Some of the infringed material is not listed on the website as for sale, but should still be held under the same license.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

As you can see above, every repository is a complete copy of some older version of my work. Please take down all existing forks of these repositories as they will be exactly the same, and I should not have to list the several hundred links that you can most likely find through your own API.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, we do not open source out work, otherwise we would not be selling it.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The repository should be removed, and seeing as half of these accounts are knowingly posting and hosting paid products, they should probably be removed from your platform as well. While I'm not attached to many of the products these people have listed on their github accounts, I know for certain that many of them are private resources never intended to be hosted in any public location. These people are dishonest and have joined your service with bad intentions.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

Unknown.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
