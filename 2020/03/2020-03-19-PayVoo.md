**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**

Yes, I am the copyright holder.

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We, SEPA Cyber Technologies, have a contract with an outsourced IT department. According to this contract, any source code belongs to SEPA Cyber Technologies.  
However, a source code related to project of a customer of ours – PayVoo, leaked in Github. We have not given permission any file to be made publicly available.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Original copyrighted work is posted here: https://www.payvoo.com/  
Source code without our permission is posted online on the following URL address: https://github.com/surajui/payvoo  
Source code belongs to SEPA Cyber Technologies, copyright to PayVoo. None of both companies have given consent this to be made publicly available. This is clear infringement. Please, take it down.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

We would like to have the whole branch removed – the code and the assets folder:  
https://github.com/surajui/payvoo  
https://github.com/surajui/payvoo/tree/master/assets

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Please remove all files and folders from the repository on https://github.com/surajui/payvoo

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

We are in a legal contract with the company that revealed the infringing information, therefore the work is legally protected. The allegedly infringing files are in violation of the legal contract.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

No, the repository should not be private, but rather than that removed.  
The best solution for us will be for the user to remove the whole repository

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

We do not have such information.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**
