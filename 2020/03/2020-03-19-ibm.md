https://github.com/itcabb/swagger-api-swagger-core/blob/master/modules/swaggerjaxrs2/src/test/java/io/swagger/v3/jaxrs2/annotations/encoding/EncodingTest.java

The link is sensitive in nature due to the following reasons:

โข The IBM Confidential and Copyright labels are noted on the following lines:
Line 2, Line 6, Line 8, Line 9 and Line 10

We have a good faith belief that the material made available on the page/links listed above
