**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We have searched for forks from 'ohyounity1' repositories. There is two repositories publishing Arction's source code without our knowledge and permission and at least one repository publicly distributing the deployment key, probably from cracked license.

LightningChart is not an open source solution. Infringing content is violating the license agreements.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

The infringing content must be removed completely.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

There is no contact information for the infringer.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**
