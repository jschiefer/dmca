**Are you the copyright holder or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf?**  
  
Yes, I am authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.  
  
**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**  
  
I am an attorney representing Spotify with authority to act on Spotify's behalf on IP enforcement matters.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
  
Anticircumvention. Meik 97 / XSpotify (“XSpotify”) violates 17 U.S.C. § 1201 by trafficking in technology that is primarily designed or produced for the purpose of circumventing Spotify’s technological measures that effectively control access to copyrighted works.  
  
Spotify employs technological measures that control how users access the copyrighted content hosted on Spotify. Copyrighted files on Spotify’s services are protected by encryption. Spotify uses a key to decrypt the copyrighted files so legitimate users can listen to the copyrighted files through the Spotify services. Spotify’s encryption system prevents users from listening to copyrighted works without Spotify’s decryption key.  
  
XSpotify states that it is a “DRM bypass” that allows users to “Download all songs directly from Spotify servers.” XSpotify’s technology circumvents Spotify’s encryption by stealing the Spotify key and using it in a way Spotify prohibits, namely, enabling users to access encrypted copyrighted content without authorization. By providing technology that circumvents Spotify’s access controls, XSpotify violates 17 U.S.C. §§ 1201(a)(2).  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
https://github.com/meik97/XSpotify  
  
**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
  
Yes. Please also remove the following:
