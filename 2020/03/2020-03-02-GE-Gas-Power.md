To whom it may concern,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

General Electric’s copyright to its proprietary OneGEApp and One GESearch computer code is being infringed at the following link. 

https://github.com/vamagra/OneGEApp/tree/master/OneGESearch

All information at the link (and all subfolders) should be removed.

The Github user name is “vamagra” and the person’s name appears to be [private]. Actions needed to remedy the infringement are deletion of the code and links from Github’s website/servers and all associated files/code on the personal storage devices of [private] (aka vamagra).

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Thank you,
