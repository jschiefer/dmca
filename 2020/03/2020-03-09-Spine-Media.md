Re:       Spine Media LLC DMCA Takedown Notice

 

To Whom It May Concern:

 

We represent Spine Media LLC (“Spine Media”), an online advertising technology company and presently a victim of willful copyright infringement. 

 

Spine Media has recently discovered that, without permission, its proprietary and copyrighted platform source code (“Spine Media’s code”) was uploaded to and made publicly available on www.github.com which, in turn, resulted in Spine Media’s computer systems being hacked.  Because these activities are illegal and are causing Spine Media to suffer grievous actual harm, we request that GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”) immediately remove Spine Media’s code from GitHub’s website and take permanent action to block those responsible from uploading anything further to GitHub’s website.

 

Pursuant to Section 512(c) of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”), Spine Media requests that GitHub remove from GitHub’s website the copyrighted material, i.e., all material, located at the following URLs:

 

1. https://github.com/Fabius-Laukaitis/dash.spinemedia.com (author: Fabius-Laukaitis aka [private]);

2. https://github.com/blkopsdev/seccoads_dashboard-Laravel (unknown author); 

3. https://github.com/micbuild/Vue.js-Laravel-dash.seccoads (unknown author); and

4. https://github.com/pdobosr/dash.spinemedia.com (unknown author).

 

For GitHub’s benefit, we have also attached screenshot images from GitHub’s website which correspond with the above URLs, some of which appear to have been already taken down.  See GitHub Screenshot Images, attached.  The entire repositories identified above infringe upon Spine Media’s code.

Given the seriousness of this matter, Spine Media further requests that GitHub immediately notify those responsible for uploading the copyrighted material, direct them to cease and desist from uploading Spine Media’s copyrighted material to GitHub’s website in the future, and block them from uploading anything further to GitHub’s website in the future.  Given that the entire repositories identified infringe upon Spine Media’s code, Spine Media requests that the entire repositories be removed from your website.

 

In accordance with GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice, which I have read and understand, I hereby swear under penalty of perjury that: (i) the material contained in the URLs identified above constitutes Spine Media’s code, constitutes Spine Media’s copyrighted material, and is owned by my client Spine Media for whom I am authorized to send this DMCA Takedown Notice; (ii) the uploading of the material contained in the URLs identified above constitutes copyright infringement and was neither authorized by Spine Media nor authorized by law, taking fair use into consideration; and (iii) the information set forth in this DMCA Takedown Notice is true and accurate. 

 

We appreciate that GitHub respects intellectual property rights and is committed to take prompt action to protect those rights.  We ask that GitHub take especially prompt action here because Spine Media’s code represents its most valuable asset and thus the company’s future is truly at stake.  Please contact me at any time ([private] or [private]) if you have any questions or if we can provide any additional information. 

 

 

Best regards,

[private]

Counsel for Spine Media LLC
