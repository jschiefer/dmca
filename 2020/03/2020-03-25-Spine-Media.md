Re: Spine Media LLC DMCA Takedown Notice

To Whom It May Concern:

We represent Spine Media LLC (“Spine Media”), an online advertising technology company.  This Revised Takedown Notice corrects a URL previously listed on our February 29, 2020 Takedown Notice.  The February 29, 2020 correspondence contained four URLs, one of which was incorrect and failed to include a trailing “-“.  The correct URL that Spine Media requests your assistance with is: https://github.com/blkopsdev/seccoads_dashboard-Laravel-

This repository infringes upon Spine Media’s source code.  Spine Media requests that you notify those responsible for uploading the copyrighted material at the above URL, direct them to cease and desist from uploading Spine Media’s copyrighted material to GitHub’s website in the future, and block them from uploading anything further to GitHub’s website in the future.  Given that this repository identified infringes upon Spine Media’s code, Spine Media requests that the repository be removed from your website.

In accordance with GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice, which I have read and understand, I hereby swear under penalty of perjury that: (i) the material contained in the URL identified above constitutes Spine Media’s code, constitutes Spine Media’s copyrighted material, and is owned by my client Spine Media for whom I am authorized to send this DMCA Takedown Notice; (ii) the uploading of the material contained in the URLs identified above constitutes copyright infringement and was neither authorized by Spine Media nor authorized by law, taking fair use into consideration; and (iii) the information set forth in this DMCA Takedown Notice is true and accurate. 

Please contact me at any time ([private] or [private]) if you have any questions or if we can provide any additional information. 
 
Best regards,
