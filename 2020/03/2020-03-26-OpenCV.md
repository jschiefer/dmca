My books, Deep Learning for Computer Vision with Python, along with supporting files from my blog, PyImageSearch.com, have been illegally posted on your site.  
  
**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

There's too many of them for me to manually copy and paste the links, but I think you get the gist.  
  
**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**  
  
This entire repo:
