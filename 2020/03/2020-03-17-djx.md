Hello Dear Github:  

We Are ChenJieLi3040667918.  
It is nice to be able to able to use GIthub such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have to be very hopefully able to get Github’s support and resolution.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
We created a Repository call “djx” in Github this year, which contained company’s internal files. Later found that before we deleted, the user named “hw233” completely forked our entire Repository, and it still exists.  
The following is Github’s URL and Screenshots about our forked Repository:

https://github.com/hw233/djx

Since “djx” contained the company’s import source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company’s internal data assets, so we hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove “djx” and thank you very much!

The following is our contact information:
