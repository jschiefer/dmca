**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No. The book content is not openly licensed. It is an all-rights-reserved work, as can be seen on page 2 of the PDF.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Given this repository contains only pirated versions of copyrighted materials, the most logical solution would be to take down the repository and all forks of it. Removing the specific PDF file "No bullshit guide to math and physics 5th Edition.pdf" would also be acceptable, provided it is removed from the git commit history making it no-longer accessible.

As a small business owner, my main concern is that these results no longer show up in search results because (1) the availability of pirate copies hurts my business, and (2) this specific pirate copy is an old version of the book which contains lots of typos and mistakes which have been corrected in most recent edition.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

I do not have any contact information beyond the user's public github profiles.

**I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.**

**I have taken <a href="https://www.lumendatabase.org/topics/22">fair use</a> into consideration.**

**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.**

**I have read and understand GitHub's <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-takedown-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Takedown Notice</a>.**

**So that we can get back to you, please provide either your telephone number or physical address.**

I will provide both:
