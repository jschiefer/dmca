For a second time, a disgruntled Ex-employee has posted a number of our private company repos publicly on your platform.
These repos are the copyright of Minxli Services UG, Germany.
I am [private] at Minxli and have been authorised by the [private] to submit this DMCA takedown notice.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

All of the repos that have been posted publicly are private here:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

This account and all repos below:

https://github.com/interpauly/ios    
https://github.com/interpauly/android  
https://github.com/interpauly/terraform

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We are not aware of any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No they are not open source.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

They must be removed.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it.**

This is who we believe posted the files. However, we have no direct evidence. No other developers have left our company on bad terms and the dates of the posts and commits correspond with his leaving date. We have little doubt.
Perhaps you can help us identify him as the same person using the Github account below.? Since he's using your platform for illegal activity (extortion, intimidation), i hope that you would be motivated to help us.
