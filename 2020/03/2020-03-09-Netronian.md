Someone who we don’t know has posted our code online without our consent. We need our code to be deleted entirely and this individual’s account to be blocked from GitHub since is following unethically practiced. I am the owner of Netronian Inc and we are building this Software for over a year now.  
This individual creates fake or multiple GitHub accounts and keeps posting our private code publicly.

We need from Github to delete the following 2 repositories:

Because they violate our code and work ethics by sharing publically the code that is supposed to be private.

These entire repositories must be taken down as soon as possible.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have contacted them a few times on Linkedin, but without any success.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

NO, this is not open source software. This is a private code and must remain private to our company only and not other individual's or companies.  
There are violations since this code is not supposed to be public or shared with everyone on a public repo.  
This repository must be taken down immediately because our hard work of over a year is being exposed at the moment without our consent publicly and internationally.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal? Can the repository be made private?**

Unfortunately, I don’t have any contact information about these users, but they must be banned from this unethical practice.
