The material contained within this repo includes software code, and related content (descriptions, instructions etc.) that is not to be distributed publicly without written consent from Devskiller.com. In such cases the posting of the material puts the integrity of our platform at a risk by allowing candidates (involved in a screening process via our platform) to use the code provided in this repo to partially or completely solve the problem posed to them by a potential employer. Such misuse may directly or indirectly result in financial burdens to our clients resulting from hiring unqualified candidates as a direct result of the content being available for public access (without restriction).  

As the contents of the repo are duplicating our proprietary technology (source code) and making it available publicly, the user is requested to immediately delete the repository in question and all offline copies of the files as well. Only this will ensure that our content doesn’t fall into the hands of unethical individuals that would try to use it to game our platform and attempt to retain employment at one of our clients based on false pretenses (cheating on an exam).
