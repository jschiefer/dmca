To whom it may concern at Github,

My name is [private] and I am [private] at Decisiv, Inc.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Several repositories publicly available are unauthorized copies of work belonging to Decisiv Inc., and are infringing on several of our copyrights. We understand the mechanics of git, github, open source licensing, etc. This work is internal private work not meant for public exposure, and the accounts in question have never been authorized to possess this source code.

These repositories we believe infringe on our copyright can be found at:

https://github.com/vipul30/decisiv

https://github.com/mikzol/react-decisiv

https://github.com/keizyr/react_decisiv

https://github.com/imfsdev/react_decisivcom

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above in the infringing github repos are not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration. We would like them removed.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
