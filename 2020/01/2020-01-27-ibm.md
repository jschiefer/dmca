Dear Sirs/Madam

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I, the undersigned, state that I am the authorized agent of the IPR owner ("IBM") of certain intellectual property rights who is a Member of the BSA Business Software Alliance, Inc. (BSA), a not-for-profit organization that protects its Members’ IPR pursuant to signed Powers of Attorney.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

BSA has determined that GitHub.com (specifically, content made available on GitHub through the links listed below) is providing access to copyrighted, nonpublic, proprietary information of our member IBM. The links lead to material that are considered confidential material, which have trade secret status.  
Specifically, the proprietary material in question can be found at the following links:

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
