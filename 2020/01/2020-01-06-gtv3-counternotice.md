There are a number of false claims or missing details in the original takedown request.   
   
1) Claim that my works were not licensed.   
This is simply not true; they were licensed under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.   
My code is fully based on https://github.com/GrowtopiaNoobs/GrowtopiaServer, which is licensed under the same license.   
   
2) That my code is based on a now deleted repository.   
It is convenient to say this as such repository is now deleted.   
Furthermore, a domain referenced in the original claim (growtopia3.com) is not even up, and does not display anything similar to my works.   
   
3) "Alleged infringer's contact information"   
It listed a Discord as my contact information, yet I do not own any accounts on this platform.   
   
There is no legal basis for this takedown, and if they wish to continue this then they can take me to court, as this case would not even hold there.   
   
**I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.**   
   
**I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.**   
   
**Please confirm that you have you have read our <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/guide-to-submitting-a-dmca-counter-notice/">Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice</a>.**   
   
**So that the complaining party can get back to you, please provide both your telephone number and physical address.**
