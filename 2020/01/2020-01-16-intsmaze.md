Before detailing the copyrighted material, I hereby claim that  I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

  I created a repository called intsmaze on GitHub in 2018ã€‚In 2020, I uploaded some code, which contained some privacy files, so I  deleted it and overwritten the commit history. But it was forked by others before deleting. I have tried to contact the user tu226 but could not reach him / her.

  https://github.com/tu226/intsmaze/tree/master/cep-storm
  https://github.com/tu226/intsmaze/tree/master/intsmaze-storm
 
  The path above contains sensitive files I care about, please delete it.

  Below are links and screenshots of GitHub:

Since the intsmaze repository contains a lot of privacy files, I hope that GitHub will help me delete the fork of tu226 in the intsmaze repository as soon as possible, thank you very much.
