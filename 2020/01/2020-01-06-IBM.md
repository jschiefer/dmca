Dear Sirs/Madam  

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I, the undersigned, state that I am the authorized agent of the IPR owner ("IBM") of certain intellectual property rights who is a Member of the BSA Business Software Alliance, Inc. (BSA), a not-for-profit organization that protects its Members’ IPR pursuant to signed Powers of Attorney.  

BSA has determined that GitHub.com (specifically, content made available on GitHub through the link listed below) is providing access to copyrighted, nonpublic, propriety information of our member IBM. The links lead to material that are considered confidential material, which have trade secret status.  

Specifically, the proprietary material in question can be found at the following link:

https://github.com/rohinijeughale/rule-schema/blob/master/services/rule-schema-manager.service.ts  

We have a good faith belief that the material made available on the page/link listed above has not been authorized by IBM, their agents, or the law for publication, listing or sale in this manner, or on your site.  

As such, we request that you please act expeditiously to remove or disable access to the specific pages/links described above, and thereby prevent the illegal reproduction and distribution of IBM content, via your company's network, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. §512(d).  

Further, BSA represents that the information in this notification is accurate and states, under penalty of perjury, that it is authorized to act in this matter on behalf of the IBM.  

We appreciate your cooperation in this matter. Please advise us regarding what actions you take.
