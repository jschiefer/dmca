Hello!

I am very sorry, but I have to admit that a repository which was recently reported as infringing
JetBrains' rights was misdetected as infringing.

It relates to this DMCA claim:  
https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-08-22-Jetbrains-2.md.

Misdetected repostories is:  
https://github.com/crazy-max/docker-jetbrains-license-server

Could you please reinstate them? We were contacted by the owner of the repository and were given
more details about the nature of the code there.  
I appreciate if you help me with this as soon as you can. I am sorry for the inconvenience.
