**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if

There are many many repos. Here are some of them. I wish there was some way
you guys could help with this. I am having to submit these DMCA requests
more and more often and it is a loosing battle for me. Isn't there some way
that you guys can flag certain files as having been taken down already and
not allow them again?
