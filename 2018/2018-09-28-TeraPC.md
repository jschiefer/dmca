Yes, I am.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
The TERA PC game server code and client code is being altered/affected by external processes for the intent to maliciously crash servers, create cheat behaviors, and the attempt to set up a private server. I have included here repositories of code that distribute bypasses for our security/anti-cheat products as well.
