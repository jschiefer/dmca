Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:  

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:  

[1] I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice;  

[2] I am a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular Section 501 of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA";

[4] I have a good faith belief that the files in the forked repositories identified below (by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the files offer to distribute a copyrighted item without authorization from the owner of the copyright.  

[5] Reason:  

Violation(s):  

Copyright Infringement  

Content Type:  

Mapillary recently discovered the unauthorized publication, disclosure, and copying of highly sensitive, confidential, trade secret, and copyright-protected documents on the below web site. Please act expeditiously to disable the content found at the following repository:  

https://github.com/AndrewVG23/mapillary_analyses  

The files located at these identified repositories contain proprietary information that belongs to Mapillary, and the original poster had no known legal authority to share this information publicly. This information is confidential and proprietary to Mapillary, was posted on GitHub without company authorization, and potentially poses a security and privacy risk to the company.  

The unauthorized copying, disclosure and distribution of Mapillaryâ€™s confidential trade secret and/or copyright-protected documents constitute a violation of both civil and criminal trade secret and copyright laws.  

[6] I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration; and  

[7] I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.  

Thank you for your kind assistance.  

Truthfully,  

[private]
