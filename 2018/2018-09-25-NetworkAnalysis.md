**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  

I am the copyright owner.  

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

I am [private] of the "Network Analysis Made Simple" GitHub repository, which I have been using as part of a tutorial series that I have delivered at a number of Python and data science conferences, including PyCon, SciPy, PyData, and ODSC. The content is available on my GitHub repository: https://github.com/ericmjl/Network-Analysis-Made-Simple/

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

The infringing repository is by the user leriomaggio, and is present here: https://github.com/leriomaggio/network-analysis-mscx18. The major changes that the infringer has done is changing the README to claim authorship over the material, as well as removing "student" versions of the notebooks available in the original.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  

Yes, there is currently one fork, [private]. However, I believe that this user is merely a learner, and not interested in claiming authorship over the content.  

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  

My work is licensed under the MIT license. The files are being used under the open source license, but are infringing on the copyright by claiming authorship. The infringer has changed the license to BSD-3.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  

Yes, there are specific changes the other person can make. Specifically, I have already raised an issue (https://github.com/leriomaggio/network-analysis-mscx18/issues/1), in which I detail a request to change his claim to authorship, such that he is no longer considered the "author" (implying original creator of the material), and instead a "workshop leader" that is using someone else's material under educational fair use, and to include a sentence that states that his material was based on the original that I [private] with [private], with a link back to the original repository. For me, this would be a satisfactory resolution of the matter.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  

I have done some searching on the internet, and found the alleged infringer's contact information here:
