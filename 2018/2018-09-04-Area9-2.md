a copyrighted test task used to evaluate programmers in our company
(variously called Tribit, Bibit and Blit). Candidates get the
test under strict NDA saying everything related to the test is
strictly confidential. Among other things, they are not allowed to
publish neither the test task description, nor any (attempted)
solutions of it. These github users have published the test task
description, thereby each violating his NDA as well as our company's
general copyright of this text.

Therefore also the code accompanying this text infringes our copyright.

4. Each user must remove the test task description and any
implementations he has made of it from github and any other location
where he may store it.
