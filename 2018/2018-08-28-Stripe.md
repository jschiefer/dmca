I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I am the legal representative authorized to act on behalf of Stripe, Inc.

I have a good faith belief that the following page being hosted by GitHub
Pages consists of a copy of our copyrighted work: http://thenexai.com

A screenshot of the NexAI copy and Stripe original page are attached. The
original is protected by registered and unregistered copyrights,
specifically including US copyright registration VAu001316348 (registered
2018-05-04).

Such use has not been authorized by Stripe, or the law, and therefore
infringes Stripeâ€™s intellectual property rights. We request that the
infringing pages be deleted.

I may be contacted by the following methods:

Email: [private]

Name: [private]

Telephone: [private]

Address: 510 Townsend Street, San Francisco CA 94103

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described
above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner,
or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this
notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am
authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is
allegedly infringed.

Regards,
