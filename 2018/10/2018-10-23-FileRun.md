The entire repository https://github.com/kochiyasanae1/filerun_decoded_nulled should be taken down, as it distributes a cracked/"nulled", reverse-engineered, version of my software product. (I suggest you check the activity of the entire user account, which is obviously a hacker.)

Yes, there seems to be no forks.

No, immediate removal is the course of action.
