I'm a software Java engineer in [private], I was post my work project into Github 2018 or earlier.I was just trying to save my code on Github. I thought no one would care about my code, because my account had very few followers at the time, and my company applied for a patent for my code in [private] which I can provide my code copyright patent information.Now I am told that the copyright of my code is not owned by me and belongs to my company. I should not have the right to publish the code open source.  
The url to the patent is : [private]  
So I immediately deleted my repository and even my account, but I don't know that my code is already on forked the Github many times.  
here are repo's links:
