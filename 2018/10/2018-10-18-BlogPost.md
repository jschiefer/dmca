I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

An older revision of my blog post ([private]) _(with sensitive data, c. f. my email address and "All Rights Reserved")_ was copied 1:1 to GitHub without my consenst.

The copyrighted work can be found here on GitHub:

https://github.com/mba811/mac-best-app/blob/master/textexpander/07.md

All forks who have the same data are to be found here:

https://github.com/awesome-archive/mac-best-app/blob/master/textexpander/07.md  
https://github.com/vincentpanqi/mac-best-app/blob/master/textexpander/07.md  
https://github.com/funkkiid/mac-best-app/blob/master/textexpander/07.md

I also contacted the repository owner and all 6 owners of forked repositories ~1.5 month ago. The only repository owners who silently complied were `[private]` and `[private]` â€” I hope the not only just made the repository private, I have no way of checking that.

I need all repositories to remove that file and more importantly their history _(see ["Removing sensitive data from a repository - User Documentation"](https://help.github.com/articles/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository/))_. Alternatively they can simply [delete the whole repository](https://help.github.com/articles/deleting-a-repository/).

**My contact info:** [private]

User names of the alleged infringer:

- mba811  
- awesome-archive  
- vincentpanqi  
- funkkiid

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
