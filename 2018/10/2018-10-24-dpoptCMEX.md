**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Yes, I'm one of the authors of the project dpopt_CMEX that has been infringed.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The work dpopt_CMEX was developed by me ([private]) and [private] to fulfill the requirements of my PhD degree at Georgetown University. The work contained some computation algorithm that was never intended to be published online, and for no reason should appear in public domains such as github.    
This can be proved by file dpopt_CMEX.cpp in the repository to be taken down (see below) which contains my name ([private]) and email address ([private]).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The repository https://github.com/proteus2/dpopt_CMEX should be taken down.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

As far as I know, there are no other forks of the repositories.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is not licensed under any open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

The best solution would be removal since the software is highly integrated and no easy changes can be made.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No, I do not have the contact information.
