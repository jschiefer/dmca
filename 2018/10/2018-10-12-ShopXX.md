Dear Github DMCA Agent:

We recently learned that a few GitHub users have posted proprietary and confidential SHOP++ owned copyrighted materials (software code) to your site and write for assistance as follows:

Please remove all of the following infringing files and folders that contain SHOP++ materials at these locatio (specific URLs) pursuant to this notice submitted under Github’s DMCA policies:

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. I have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the above information is accurate and that I am authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.

We appreciate your assistance as we investigate the activities that lead to the unauthorized posting of SHOP++’s materials.
