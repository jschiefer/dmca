1. I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Counter Notice.  
2. The content in question is at https://github.com/wsus-script/WSUS-Script

4. I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled  
5. I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.

And again, I am not removing anything since I have the legal right to have it on my github per the TOS on SpiceWorks under which the scripts were posted.  The original author can go pound salt.
