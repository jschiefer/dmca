We have searched the forks, no forks effected.

No, our SDK is not under any open source license, here is our SDK License Agreement: https://www.portsip.com/portsip-sdk-license-agreement/

We ask GITHUB help to delete the related repos or files, or make these repos to private/invisible.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

No, don't have these contacts, seems the customers leaked the key.
