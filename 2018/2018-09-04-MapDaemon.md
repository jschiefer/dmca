**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s
behalf?**  
I am the rights holder.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work
that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it
is posted online.**    
The original work is an external script written in Java called MapDaemon.
It is generally designed to be used with the game Space Station 13 and I
allowed it to be used by an organization called "CM-SS13" (previously
"Colonial Marines: Space Station 13"). I am the exclusive rights holder and
have granted only CM-SS13 and it's developers use of this work.
The work is contained on a private GitLab repository, here:  
[private]  
That URL should be inaccessible to those unauthorized to view it so here is
a screenshot of what is contained at that link:

I have previously filed a DMCA against all of the users targeted in this
takedown notice, I was informed by GitHub support of the disabling of their
content or the owner's compliance with the requested removal, to my
knowledge none of them filed a counter-notice, and all of them have
subsequently bypassed GitHub's takedown measures, some by reforking the
same original repository (not listed in this takedown notice) but putting
2019 or 2020 in the title instead of the original 2018 and some by
completing the changes required in the original DMCA takedown and then
pulling the infringing content back from the original repository.
