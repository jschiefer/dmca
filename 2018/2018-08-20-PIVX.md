I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

The PIVX code base is what has been violated. The requirements under our open-source MIT use license is that any project may clone and reuse our code base provided that they leave " ALL " Copyright notices in place. This includes the COPYING (license) file as well as all the code headers showing work that work has been done by the respective developers, as well as upstream copyrights.

The entire repo should be taken down or otherwise frozen until the appropriate copyrights and license is restored.

We are in the process of searching for forked projects based on this project, and will be submitting a new take down notice for each repo we find. In cases where an offending repository has enabled the github issue tracker, and curtsey notice detailing the issue and the subsequent course of action has been made.

Yes, our source code is based on the open-source MIT license

These projects should either have their repo completely removed or they should make the necessary changes to maintain the correct copyright notices and/or license file.

As requested, I am resubmitting these on one form in lieu of multiple forms for each violation.
