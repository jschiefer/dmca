To whom it may concern,

This is Data Security Team of Tencent, China.  
Recently, we noticed one Github repository contains sensitive information of our company.  
After reading and understanding GIthub's Guide to filing a DMCA Notice, we decide to send this message. And we appreciate very much for your help and support.

Our company staff created a repository named "temp" on Mar 11 at 2018. Unfortunately, this repository contained sensitive information such as creators, contents, domain, login user and passwords.  
All these information is owned by Tencent. So we have contacted the author and deleted the content. However, later we found another user named "gprolog" already forked the entire repository. This cannot be controlled by our side.  
We have tried to contact the user, but with no response.

The URL and the screenshot of one sensitive information example in the forked repository are shown as follows:  
https://github.com/gprolog/temp

Since the repository contains critical source code and sensitive credential information of our company, we do hope Github could help us completely remove the repository "gprolog/temp".

The following is our contact information:  
* Company Name: Tencent Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd  
* My email address: [private]  
* Cellphone: [private]  
* Website: https://www.tencent.com

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.  
I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

Looking forward to your reply. Thanks a lot!

Best regards,
