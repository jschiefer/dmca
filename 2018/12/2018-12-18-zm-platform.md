To whom it may concern, 

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice. 

Our company's management platform “zm platform” is infringed by repository https://github.com/zhanght86/zm-platform-cooperation/. 

This is a Java web program with Spring and Mybatis as its framework. Zm-pm is the front end to interact with users and zm-platform is the back end to provide interfaces to process data and realize the program logic. This management platform has 6 main modules responding to 6 business components, which include Finance Workstation, Teaching workstation, Sale Workstation, Market Workstation and Administration Workstation. Finance workstation is designed to deal with orders and to interact with different payment interfaces. Teaching workstation is a platform for managing teachers and students. While sale Workstations works as the platform for salesman to interact with our customers, market workstation is our market back end. Because the source codes responds to our internal management platform, it is not convenient to give out the URL and show to the public.

The whole repository is uploaded by one of our employee [private]. [private] has deleted his repository, but the repository is forked by zhanght86. We cannot find zhanght86's contact information in his profile, so we submit this notice to request zhanght86 deleting the repository and all its copies and Github removing this repository. If you have any question, please contact my email address [private]. Thank you.
