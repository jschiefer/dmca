Dear DMCA Copyright Agent:

Our firm serves as outside legal counsel for Morgan Stanley (“Morgan Stanley”), which is the exclusive holder of all copyright interests in various original computer code that is literally reproduced at the URLs below (the “Work”). The Work is also confidential so no public link exists for the Work.

It has come to our attention that a website located at www.github.com (the “Site”) has copied and is displaying the Work without authorization from Morgan Stanley.

This letter shall serve as notice of infringement and provides the following information:

1. We are the duly authorized representative of Morgan Stanley, the exclusive rights holder of the copyrighted Work currently being infringed on the Site.

2. The infringing material is located at the following URL(s) within the Site. Each of the URLs reproduces in its entirety original computer code owned by Morgan Stanley and protected under copyright:
