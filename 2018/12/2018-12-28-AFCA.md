Hello Dear Github:

We Are AFCA（Tianjin）Information Technology Co.,Ltd. It is nice to be able
to use Github such a professional and efficient platform,

and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github’s support
and resolution.

We have read and understand GitHub’s Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Recently, we found that [private] (former employee of the company)
uploaded the delivery code of Zhangjiakou Bank to github in October 2015

without the authorization of the company. We contacted him to have the code
removed from github. But his code has been forked three times without
authorization and is still there.

The following is [private]’s screenshot,and now have been deleted from
github by himself .(the URL is
[private])

The following is Github’s URL and Screenshots about [private] forked
Repository:

https://github.com/jarvisxiong/zhangjiakou_municipal_bank

https://github.com/LeeNewbie/zhangjiakou_municipal_bank

https://github.com/wangdajie123/zhangjiakou_municipal_bank

Since the code contains the Zhangjiakou Bank’s important source
code,algorithm and system configuration information, so we hope Github as
soon as possible to help us compelely remove
