I was recently made aware that a user had copied the contents of one of my popular repositories into his own, without git history, and with replaced copyright statements, effectively trying to claim my project for his.

My project is https://github.com/sivel/speedtest-cli

I started my project on Mon Sep 10 12:17:53 2012 -0700 based on git history. And the project includes:

```
# Copyright 2012-2018 [private]  
# All Rights Reserved.
```

The users copied project is https://github.com/CybernetiX-S3C/Speedtest-cli

The other user, has changed this to:

```
# Copyright 2012-2018 [private] CybernetiX-S3C  
# All Rights Reserved.
```

However, the user did not make any changes to the `setup.py` file which still indicate me.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
