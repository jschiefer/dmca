Hello Dear Github:  
My name is [private] from Jingshuo technology group Inc and my Github's name is zhen2016gao. It's nice to be able to use Github such a profrssional and efficient platform, and now we have need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resolution.  
I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.  
In 2017,I created a Repository called "estimateSystem", This project includes analytic hierarchy process, and the most important thing is the implementation logic of this algorithm. I don't want it to be disclosed. and it contains some sensitive information,such as internal and external network IP address, as well as database password, E-mail password and other sensitive information,this can lead to data leakage and irreparable damage. Later found that before I deleted, the user named yangzilong1986 completely forked my entire Repository, and it still exists.  
The following is Github's URL and Screenshots about he forked Repository:
