Hello Dear Github

I have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github's support and resoultion.  
I have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.

The following is Github's URL about my forked Repository  
https://github.com/Postgre/Soultion_WarehouseManagementSystem

Since "Postgre/Soultion_WarehouseManagementSystem" contains the company's source code,
so I hope Github as soon as possible to help me completely remove "Postgre/Soultion_WarehouseManagementSystem" and thank you very much!

The following is my contact information:

Hoping for your response,and thanks again.
