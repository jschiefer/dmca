Dispute the notice

**Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake? (optional)**  

I acknowledge that I have referred to some of the design of the Sabberstone project among the codes raised by the DMCA. I sincerely apologize for this. However, Sabberstone (C#) and Hearthstonepp (C++) are projects that have been created in different languages. The 'Sources' folder also contains a number of our own code. Therefore, I think it is unfair to raise a problem with the entire folder. I tried to e-mail the Sabberstone maker after receiving the DMCA notice, but I didn't get any answers. If they tell you more about the problem, I'll let you know that I'm willing to change the license or change the logic.
