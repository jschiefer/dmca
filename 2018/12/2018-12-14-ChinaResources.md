Hello Dear Github:  
We are
China Resources (Holdings) Co., Ltd. We appreciate the professional and efficient service provided by Github as an open platform.  
However we now have an emergent situation that endangers our system security and digital copyright. We NEED your attention and help.  

We have read and understand Github's Guide to Filling a DMCA Notice.  

One employee from our company [private] carelessly created a public repository with name "menu", which contains all our code and some sensitive information, on May 15.  
And later it was forked by three other people whose accounts are hejie, xuelu520, Zhaoyu1105. Following are the related screenshots.  

We have contacted the original committer [private] to remove his repository. Then we tried hard to contact the forking users, however, their contact info are limited or missing. So we resort to you to help us.  

Since these public repositories contain our important source code, system configurations, etc, we hope Github can aid us to remove them completely, including:  
https://github.com/hejie/menu  
https://github.com/xuelu520/menu  
https://github.com/ZhaoYu1105/menu  
We need your fast resolution. Thank you very much!
