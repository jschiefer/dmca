Hi, I am a [private] of Augmentum Inc. We have found a resigned employee commit our project source code to github 3 years ago. The source code contains a lot of sensitive info such as DB password.
We have already send a take down notice to that project before, and it is taken down now. The url of that project is:   [private].

Currently, we have found two fork projects:  
- Yuri364/uhkklp (https://github.com/Yuri364/uhkklp)  
- zeroisstart/uhkklp (https://github.com/zeroisstart/uhkklp)  
These project are completely forked project from [private], they did not change anything. So if you searched the Copyright, you still can find a lot of code contains the info: "© Copyright 2013-2014 Augmentum".

So we requested to take down entire repository.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
https://github.com/Yuri364/uhkklp  
https://github.com/zeroisstart/uhkklp

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
No more forked projects except these two.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
The entire project is a business project. Not an open source project.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
The best solution is remove these two projects from github.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
Sorry, I dont have.
