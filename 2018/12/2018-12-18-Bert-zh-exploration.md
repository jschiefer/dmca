Hello Dear Github:  
*I am [private]*  
It is nice to be able to use Github such a nice and professional
platform to maintain my codes. It is really sorry that I have a need to be
very hopefully able to get Github’s support and resolution now.
* I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.*
I created a Project called *“Bert_zh_exploration”* recently, which
contained *“datasets/*”* are all owned by our company. Later found that
before we deleted, the user named* “haiyangasd” and “4rt3mi5” *completely
forked my entire Project, and they still exists.
The following are Githubs’ URL and Screenshots about forked
Projects are shown below:

Since* “Bert_zh_exploration”* contains the company’s *important
source and configuration information, belonging to the company’s internal
data assets*, so I hope Github as soon as possible to help me completely
remove these two Projects or *delete “datasets/*” without leaving any
traces (Can not be restored) and any other Projects forking from these*,
thank you very much!

Unfortunately, I can not connect with both forkers because of the
insufficient information they leave on their pages.
