Hello Github,



I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.



Github user [private] has contributed and posted copyrighted Mastercard data in the following files:



https://github.com/1newstar/oracle-1/blob/bc98dea16c535a8d7f6868f8fe9f62d3fef9ceff/apex/ldap_dynamic_list.sql

https://github.com/1newstar/oracle-1/blob/bc98dea16c535a8d7f6868f8fe9f62d3fef9ceff/apex/ldap_settings.sql

https://github.com/1newstar/oracle-1/blob/bc98dea16c535a8d7f6868f8fe9f62d3fef9ceff/oem/secure_oms.sh



These files contain data which is proprietary to Mastercard and should not be published externally.



The user needs to remove these files as it contains proprietary Mastercard data and was not approved to be posted externally. These files contain system data, certificates, and LDAP credentials which are owned by Mastercard and are not approved for external use. The files listed above need to be removed.



I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.



I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.



Please let me know if you have any questions.



Thank you.
