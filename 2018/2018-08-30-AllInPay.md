Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
This is a very sensitive product in the financial field. In the project of fork, relevant configuration information indicates that the project is unique to our company

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
link : https://github.com/n040661/allinpay-1

The project has not received open source license.And it's very private

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

I only have his account name and the project address of fork:
