**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  
YES

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
The original project: YXMobileAppPlatform was created by me in 2016( My nick name was [private] at that time), and then GitHub user beelives folked my project: https://github.com/beelives/YXMobileAppPlatform,  
([private])   
You can see that info here: https://github.com/beelives/YXMobileAppPlatform/commits/master

I deleted my project for copyright reason and sent email to beelives to ask him to delete the project he folked. But he did not response, and the folked project is still there making a big problem to the owner.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
URL: https://github.com/beelives/YXMobileAppPlatform

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
For now I only find one project that need removed: https://github.com/beelives/YXMobileAppPlatform

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

There is no license for my project, I put it on GitHub just for remote work, I do not want anyone to copy it.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
I just need any projects born from YXMobileAppPlatform disappear in GitHub.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
His account is beelives, his email is [private]
