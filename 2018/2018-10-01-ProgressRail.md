**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  
Yes, I'm an actual developer of this proprietary, internal-use-only application at Progress Rail.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
This is a proprietary Progress Rail application, only used internally. I have no idea how the source code made its way out. The application is not accessible on the open Internet.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
This repo -- https://github.com/mpetrov83/icar

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
I don't see any further indications of forks on Github -- https://github.com/mpetrov83/icar/network/members

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**  
It is not licensed for any use whatsoever outside of Progress Rail.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
This is a complete copy of the proprietary application's source code from 2012, so its complete removal is the only remedy.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
The Github account is all I have -- https://github.com/mpetrov83  
There is another account that appears to have originally committed the code into the repo -- [private]
