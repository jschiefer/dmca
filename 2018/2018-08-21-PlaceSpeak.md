Hi,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

On or before March 25, 2018, someone acquired a copy of our private github repo
[private] and has posted it to their own public repo
(https://github.com/Blas-P12/placespeak).

This is clearly our copyright protected code and this amounts not a simple license violation
(they have no license from us and this is not open source code) but instead is clear cut theft
of IP.

There is no contact information for the previously mentioned repo and we'd really appreciate
having our private code removed as soon as possible.

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the
infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I
am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
