Hello Dear Github:

I am soft developer, a fans of github.

It is very nice to use github such a professional and efficient platform, and now i am hopefully to get Github's support and resolution.

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

I create Repository called "code" five years ago. Later found that before I deleted, the user name joyfish completely cloned my Repository, and it still exists, the url is https://github.com/joyfish/code.

Since "code" contain my important source code, so I hope Github to help me remove joyfish/code completely as soon as possible.

Thank you very much!
