Hello Dear Github:

We are gome Inc.It is nice to be able to use Github such a professional and efficient platform, and now we have a need to be very hopefully able to get Github’s support and resolution.

We have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Our company created a Repository called “gome-jn”on 2018-08-15, which contained creators and contents are all owned by the company. Later found that before we deleted, the users gangsikunchong and jdango completely forked our entire Repository, and it still exists.

Now we have deleted our Repository. The followings are Github’s URL and Screenshots about our forked Repository:

https://github.com/jdango/gome-jn  
[4(Y43~TIJ%UM8FQ)(@O8$6C]

https://github.com/gangsikunchong/gome-jn  
[R4OU{8GOSB%R)6A}BDT4NRT]

Since “gome-jn” contains the company’s important source code, algorithm and system configuration information, belonging to the company's internal dabta assets, so we hope Github as soon as possible to help us completely remove jdango/gome-jn and gangsikunchong/gome-jn and thank you very much!
