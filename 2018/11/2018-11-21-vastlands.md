Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.

It included a leak which has users IP, Address, etc. And work which was done by me from www.vastlands.net
The sources, etc, was developed by me, and an EX Developer that was fired leaked the project source code, which was private. It all should not be available to the public at all!

That's why I ask it to be removed.
