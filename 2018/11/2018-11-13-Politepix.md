Takedown Notice under DMCA

Date: October 29th, 2018

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

Dear GitHub Copyright Agent:

I, the undersigned, state UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY that:

[1] I am, a person injured, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of a person injured by a violation of the U.S. Copyright laws, in particular section(s) 1201(a)(2) and/or 1201(b)(1) of Title 17 of the United States Code, commonly referred to as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, or "DMCA"; I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.

[2] I May Be Contacted At:

Name of Injured Party : Politepix UG (haftungsbeschränkt), henceforth referred to as Politepix

Name and Title: [private]

Company: Politepix UG (haftungsbeschränkt)

Address: Paul-Lincke-Ufer 5

City, State, and Zip: Berlin 10999

Email address: [private]

Telephone: [private]

[3] I have a good faith belief that the repositories identified below (by URL) are unlawful under these laws because, among other things, the repositories publicly redistribute copyrighted binary software products for which no right or permission to redistribute has been given.

[4] Reason:

In the case of the following repository, it redistributes Politepix's copyrighted commercial binary software product RapidEars, in the form of the binary RapidEarsDemo.framework, without permission or any granted right to redistribute:

https://github.com/kavitamevada01/voicerecognization/

Example:

https://github.com/kavitamevada01/voicerecognization/tree/master/ios/Framework/RapidEarsDemo.framework

More about RapidEars here: http://www.politepix.com/rapidears

In the case of the following repository, it redistributes Politepix's copyrighted commercial binary software product Rejecto, in the form of the binary Rejecto.framework, without permission or any granted right to redistribute:

https://github.com/sameervijay/Flashify/tree/master/Flashcards/Rejecto.framework

More about Rejecto here: http://www.politepix.com/rejecto

It can be seen that no license information has been uploaded to these repos along with these binaries, since the licenses would indicate that the binaries can't be redistributed in this way.

[5] I have personally contacted both of the owners of these repositories directly, attempting email contact two times or more in each case to request that they get in touch so we can solve the problem, as I believe that these are fixable mistakes and I also believe the DMCA is a crude tool and an accomodation of last resort. However, the owners of these repositories have not responded to my contact, although in both cases we have corresponded previously via email, so I am unfortunately aware that there is no impediment to discussion other than a lack of interest in it. As a result I am regretfully requesting the takedown of the infringing binary software bundles.

Please act expeditiously to remove the following infringing copyrighted software files from these repositories:

https://github.com/kavitamevada01/voicerecognization/ios/Framework/RapidEarsDemo.framework (the infringing software to be removed is the software bundle "RapidEarsDemo.framework")

https://github.com/sameervijay/Flashify/tree/master/Flashcards/Rejecto.framework (the infringing software to be removed is the software bundle "Rejecto.framework")

[6] I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration, and;

[7] The information in this notice is accurate.

Thank you for your kind assistance.

Truthfully,

[private]  
Politepix UG (haftungsbeschränkt)
