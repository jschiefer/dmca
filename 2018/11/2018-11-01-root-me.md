**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

The copyright owner is root-me.org.  
root-me.org asked me to remove my commits in forked repository from other github members.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

I’ve published hacking challenges solutions on a repository in 2013 ([private]) which violated conditions of root-me.org websites (https://www.root-me.org/en/Information/Legal-Disclaimer/).  
Root-me.org contacted me in 2014 to remove that repository which I did immediately.  
The problem is that the repository has been forked several times before the removal.

I’ve found that fork : heartbleeded/hacking-challenges/ which has been also forked by other people : https://github.com/heartbleeded/hacking-challenges/network/members

You can see that all commits on that repository was made by me ([private]).

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I’ve found the forks described above.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

I didn’t put any license in my initial repository.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

No, I’ve been asked from root-me.org to remove that content, which I did years ago (in 2014) but I’m looking a solution to remove forks.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

I’ve contacted by email people which have published their contact information (see list below) but wasn’t able to find others github members contact information.
