The GitHub user "risenforward" worked for us for a very short time. He had access to our private repository: [private]  
After his test period is finished we disabled him access because he didn't deliver what we agreed and expected from him. After that, he published our property on his GitHub account publicly. This is a second time that we report abuse from him. The first time was in May this year. https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2018/2018-05-17-DigitalMR.md

We didn't find any forks.

No. The work is totally private.

No, removing is the only option.

We only have his GitHub account: risenforward
