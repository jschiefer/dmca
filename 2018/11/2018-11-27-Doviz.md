The repositories below either document or exemplify the usage of, and therefore publicly expose our (Doviz.com's) private API, which is obtained by reverse engineering our website and mobile applications:

The aforementioned API is solely developed for delivering real-time financial data that we purchase from 3rd-party data providers to be used on our website and mobile applications. Therefore, the repository not only exposes our private asset, but also violates our agreements wıth the 3rd-party data providers.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Yes, the following repositories are forks of the original repositories and therefore, must also be removed:

https://github.com/prosman/dj_dovizcom  
https://github.com/abdulkadirgunay/doviz  
https://github.com/aligurbuz/kaca

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the work is proprietary and not licensed under an open source license.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Since all the repositories' main functionalities are making use of our private API, they and their forks should be removed entirely. For the Gist, removal of the file "fonksiyon.php" would suffice.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

We do not have alleged infringers' contact information. However, their GitHub usernames are:
