**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**  

Yes, I'm [private] of Running with Crayons Ltd. We develop Alfred for Mac, and have been made aware by our users that a number of hacked versions have been made available via Github. These versions contravene our licensing system to allow users to get the paid version for free.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  

Alfred is a productivity application for Mac (quite popular amongst GitHub staff in fact!), and you can download it from https://www.alfredapp.com

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  

https://github.com/PengJiang520/Alfred3Powerpack

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**
