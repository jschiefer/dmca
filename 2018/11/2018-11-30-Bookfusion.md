**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

The entire repository should be removed https://github.com/Wings1986/Bookfusion-Android

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

Have not found any forks at this time.
