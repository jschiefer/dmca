**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

Yes.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It is code which has been contributed to, which was expected to not be published anywhere. All of the code is unlicensed, and I had never signed a contract to give PartyCubed LTD (the company that the code was written for) ownership or copyrights.
It is closed source, not posted anywhere online, and I no longer have access to it, as I am no longer at the company. although you may contact [private] or [private] to get a hold of it if that is absolutely necessary. They will also be able to vouch that I have contributed to the files that I have linked.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**

In the following list, if a directory is linked that means I have contributed to every single file that is contained in the directory, and every single file in any subdirectories.

There are several more files that I _believe_ that I own copyright for, but I have decided not to link them if I am not 100% sure.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

I have searched for forks and have not found any.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

No, the code is unlicensed.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

Removal of the repository would be optimal. The "other person" in this request is unknown.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**

It looks like GitHub user [private] posted it, although I thoroughly believe the username was spoofed. I contacted him, and he stated that he would gladly take down the repository if he could, but he does not have permission to do so. If there are internal logs that GitHub can use to see the authenticated creator of the remote NemeGaming/MCPZ repository, those could be used to get the infringer's contact information.
