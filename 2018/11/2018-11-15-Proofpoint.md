**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

The infringement is our IDS Signature Ruleset. This is behind an authenticated system. ETPro is GPLv2 licensed, and customers cannot share the ruleset per our EULA. We have a separate ruleset called ETOpen which is permissible to share, but all instances of the violation are for our commercial ETPro ruleset.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

It looks like there is a fork above, as there are two AlienVault repos that have the same infringing code, i listed all of the links just the same.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

It is not open source, each file has it's license clearly stated (most of these files were copied in whole and even have the offending license text, though some just copied out individual rules and omitted the license)

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

All of these rules are Proofpoint's IP so they need to remove them. We publish an ET Open ruleset which is BSD licensed and meant for non-paying customers to use: https://rules.emergingthreats.net/open/snort-2.9.0/

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
I provided the owner of the repo for each of the 58 separate instances above.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration."**

I have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted materials described above on the infringing web pages is not authorized by the copyright owner, or its agent, or the law. I have taken fair use into consideration.

**Type (or copy and paste) the following statement: "I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed."**

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that the information in this notification is accurate and that I am the copyright owner, or am authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
