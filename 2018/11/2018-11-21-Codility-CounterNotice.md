Codility is blatantly abusing the GitHub DMCA notice system and should be barred from using it. This is not the first time I have submitted a counter notice to their takedowns, that GitHub resulted in re-instating the repos. Its blatant abuse of the system. The content is question is a string test, that is in fact open source, and exists in many how to coding books that are not the copy write of Codility, on many blogs that are not the copyright of codilitys, and here on github. I have never used the codility platform and as the links they provide are behind a paywall they are not capable of proving any type of copyright violation.
