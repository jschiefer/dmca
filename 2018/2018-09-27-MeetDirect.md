**Are you the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner’s behalf?**

yes, I'm one of the [private] of the company the work belongs to.

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

It is a privat GIT repo. The github user etac1993 participated in a large software project, owned by [private] (named meet.direct), and signed an NDA. Now he periodically uploads the entire source code of this project on his private github account, publicly visible, as part of his portfolio. We have approached him about it before, in response to which he deleted his github account. He seems to have multiple accounts and has already been warned that further action will be taken if he re-uploads the code.

Here is the URL of our copyrighted work:

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**

We don't know about any forks.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?**

The project is privat and fully confidential. For sure we also use open source tools within our project, but the work it self completely belongs to us.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**

No, it need to be removed and destroyed asap. It is "work for hire" and he has no right to use or publish this code.
