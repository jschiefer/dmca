I am the copyright owner.



The copyright infringed work is some of the notes I worked on at Baidu, because the notes involved the company's security red line, so I uploaded in June the next morning at six or seven o'clock, the note has been deleted, which contains some internal articles and internal Hadoop client SSH accounts and passwords. The address of the library currently being infringed on copyright is:



https://github.com/H6yV7Um/BD_Work



So far I've only found this one fork and the other cool ones I haven't found yet. If you find exactly the same BD_wrok library that's been fork's, please help me delete it.



The infringement document is an open library I set up to satisfy the open source license.



The best solution to the infringement program is to delete the fork library



I have no contact information for infringers, only his GitHub address.
