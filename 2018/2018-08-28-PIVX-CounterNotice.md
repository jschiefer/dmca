Are you the owner of the content that has been disabled, or authorized to act on the owner’s behalf?  
- Yes, however, a representative named [private] whom I have given permission and is representing me for my personal security.

What files were taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:  
-https://github.com/XUEZ/xuez.

Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?

-Dispute the notice as I believe that our content on GitHub was mistakenly disabled by a DMCA takedown request, we have ensured that all copyright material is presented as seen on the main.cpp file. Additionlly, We have contacted the Pivx team and we know where the Copyright issues are found - We have contacted other projects and when the DMCA notice has been taken down we will push these changes too.   
Example of changes which we will push:
