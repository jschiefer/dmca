- Yes

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**  
- I wrote a series of Android/Kotlin articles in Medium which include and are supported by a public project I host on GitHub. One individual decided to go and create (not write) his own article, which consists in basically my content, all the text is copied letter by letter from my articles, and also the code snippets are copied. This was already reported to Medium, but apart from that he went further and also created a GitHub project to back up his article, but in that project, he uploaded my code as well, still with references to my name that I used as an example in a piece of code.

He seems to have created his own Android Project as he's using more recent versions of the framework and other libraries which dependencies are added by default when creating the project. But the content of the class MainActivity.kt is an exact copy of mine, it has an extra comment which is basically a line of code I have on a different revision of the same file. The layout file for the MainActivity is also a complete copy of mine using the same resource ids and same configuration I used.

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL:**  
- Both the MainActivity.kt and activity_main.xml files should be removed. Links above.

**Have you searched for any forks of the allegedly infringing files or repositories? Each fork is a distinct repository and must be identified separately if you believe it is infringing and wish to have it taken down.**  
- There are no forks from his project at the moment.

**Is the work licensed under an open source license? If so, which open source license? Are the allegedly infringing files being used under the open source license, or are they in violation of the license?** 
- The code that was used wrongly had no license at the time the infringing repository was created, as I didn't realise I needed a specific license, assume I was bound to a default one. I added an MIT license since I found about this violation.

**What would be the best solution for the alleged infringement? Are there specific changes the other person can make other than removal?**  
- I would like for the requested content to be taken down from Github. I tried to contact the person directly to remove it but was ignored and didn't get any response.

**Do you have the alleged infringer’s contact information? If so, please provide it:**  
- I have his Github: https://github.com/laxmansahni  
And his Twitter: [private]
