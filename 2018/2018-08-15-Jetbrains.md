Infringement Notice  

Dear Sirs/Madams,  

We have been notified that licence keys, binary code and source code of license server serving
licenses to products of our company JetBrains s.r.o. (such as
Upsource, PhpStorm, WebStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, IntelliJ IDEA, AppCode, ReSharper, CLion,
DataGrip), the URLs of the illegally run license servers,
cracks (software which intentionally and illegally modifies JetBrains tools in order to run it on
behalf of a third party without an authorization from JetBrains)
and instructions on how to use the cracks are publicly accessible on your website github.com.    

Some of the infringing materials contain a disclaimer which says that the materials do not have a
private key, and thus are not truly infringing. Please note that such claim is a forgery, because
private keys are easy to find in the Internet, as well as at GitHub in other repositories. Thus, we
ask to remove all the materials which can be used to build a software which violates JetBrains
rights by generating illicit activation codes, regardless of how many repositories the source codes
are distributed among.  

JetBrains s.r.o. is an owner of registered trademarks for all of the products specified above, those
are proprietary desktop software products.  

The materials infringing JetBrains s.r.o. rights mentioned above are to be found in particular on
the following links:
