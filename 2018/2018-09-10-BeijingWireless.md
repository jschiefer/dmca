Hi there,

I have read and understand GitHub's Guide to Filing a DMCA Notice.

A company created a repository a year ago, and I have removed the repository
from github due to security privacy issues. But later I found out that I
have been forked by someone else. Now I want the administrator to help me
delete this repository for someone else fork.

This is the repository address I deleted before:

[private]

This is another user fork my address:

https://github.com/aiyes/chexian

I hope that github official will help me completely remove this repository.
