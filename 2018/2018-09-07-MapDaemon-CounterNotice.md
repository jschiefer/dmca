Do you want to make changes to your repository or do you want to dispute the notice?  
I am disputing this notice.

Is there anything else you think we should know about why you believe the material was removed as a result of a mistake?

MapDaemon(henceforth referred to as `The Work') was provided to a GPL based codebase to be used in that GPL based codebase as a build tool with the author knowing the codebase was GPL, knowing The Work would be bundled within this codebase and subject to the GPL.

As such The Work is licensed for our use under the GPL as a build tool/script, and byond that, as a peice of a combined GPL work, and their moment to object to such licensing was before they provided The Work to a codebase they knew was GPL.

This was explained to the author in conversations[1] leading up to the submission of The Notice. The author conspicuously did not submit a takedown notice to the master/parent repo[2] because he knows this DMCA notice has no merits and I would contest[3] it. This is nothing more than an attempt to abuse the DMCA process to harass contributors to the master/parent repo because he knows they aren't as willing to defend themselves.

If The Author of The Work would like his work removed, he or she merely needs to publicly apologize to the overall Space Station 13 community for his or her abuse of the DMCA process via a post to the /r/ss13 subreddit[4], than ask *nicely* for the content to be removed.

While we believe we have a legal right to use or distribute it, we already plan to move over to another system for compiling map changes and we had gladly removed[5] The Work once before until[6] the author started abusing the DMCA to harass our contributors.

but considering you and others have said that you will counter-notice anything I file against you, I am reluctant to file directly against you before I explore all of the options to
resolve this.''

I have read github's Guide to Submitting a DMCA Counter Notice.

I swear, under penalty of perjury, that I have a good-faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.

I consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which my address is located (if in the United States, otherwise the Northern District of California where GitHub is located), and I will accept service of process from the person who provided the DMCA notification or an agent of such person.
